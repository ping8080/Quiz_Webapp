<li>The nurse administers 100% oxygen to the client during and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to prevent anoxia due to medically induced paralysis of respiratory muscles. During ECT, muscle relaxants are administered to prevent physical injury from seizure activity. However, these muscle relaxants can also paralyze the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and anoxia. By administering 100% oxygen, the nurse ensures that the client&rsquo;s brain and other vital organs receive adequate oxygenation during and after the procedure.</li>
<li>Option a is incorrect because while hypoxia can increase intracranial pressure (ICP), this is not the primary reason for administering oxygen during ECT. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Option b is incorrect because while ECT can cause changes in blood pressure and heart rate, administering oxygen is not primarily done to prevent hypotension, bradycardia, and bradypnea.</li>

Disulfiram blocks this oxidation by inhibiting ALDH, causing a rapid rise of acetaldehyde in the blood when alcohol is consumed. The result is called a disulfiram-alcohol reaction. The reaction usually begins about 10 to 30 minutes after alcohol is ingested.</li>

<li>The treatment plan should include systematic desensitization, an effective therapy for fears, phobias, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. It is based on the principle of classical conditioning. It involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared object or situation in a controlled and relaxed environment. The process combines relaxation techniques with a hierarchical exposure to the anxiety-causing stimulus, allowing the individual to confront and reduce their fear without an anxiety response gradually. <strong>Hence, option a. is correct. </strong></li>
<li>Stress management is appropriate for overall anxiety and stress, however, it may not address the phobia of the patient.</li>
<li>Assertiveness training is usually focused on improving communication and self-expression.</li>

<li>Idea of reference is a symptom where a person believes that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in the environment have a special and personal meaning for them. In the case of the schizophrenic patient believing that television broadcasts contain secret messages specifically for him, this fits well with the concept of ideas of reference. The patient is interpreting neutral content (television programs) as having a direct and significant message intended solely for him.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale for other options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A delusion is a false belief that is firmly held despite clear and obvious evidence to the contrary. While the belief that the television is sending secret messages can also be classified as a delusion, delusions tend to be broader and more encompassing. This specific belief might be considered a delusional idea of reference, but the term "idea of reference" is more precise in this context.</li>
<li>Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that occur without any external stimulus. For example, hearing voices that are not there or seeing things that do not exist. In this case, the patient is not experiencing a hallucination because they are perceiving real external stimuli (the television broadcasts) but interpreting them incorrectly.</li>
<li>An illusion is a misinterpretation of a real external stimulus. For example, mistaking a shadow for a person. In this case, the patient is not misinterpreting the sensory input from the television; rather, they are attributing a false meaning to it. Therefore, this does not fit the definition of an illusion.</li>

<li>Phallic stage (3-6 years): During this stage, the child&rsquo;s libido (sexual energy) is focused on the genital area.

Thus, the genital area is indeed the object of attention and attraction in this stage.</li>

<li>Latency stage (6-puberty): This stage is characterized by a period of relative calm in terms of psychosexual development.

<li>Mood stabilizers are the primary class of medications used to treat&nbsp;bipolar&nbsp;disorder. They work to help stabilize mood and prevent episodes of&nbsp;mania&nbsp;or depression.</li>

<li>Lithium carbonate is the salt of monovalent cation lithium.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is predominantly used to cure episodes of mania.</li>
<li>Lithium causes a fall in GSK-3-beta concentrations which cause an increase in beta-catenin concentrations in the body. This molecule is responsible for mood stabilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It does not cause euphoria (which means abnormal elevation of mood).</li>
<li>It does not cause sedation or hypnosis. In fact, it is seen to decrease the amount of sleep in patients of mania.</li>
<li>It is slow to act, and cures the episode of mania in 1-2 weeks, not days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Other options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium sulfate, lithium chloride and lithium nitrate are used in other industries, and not prescribed for mania. Thus they are incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Option A: Lithium sulfate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar disorder is treated with lithium sulfate.</li>
<li>As a possible ingredient for ion conducting glasses, lithium sulfate is being studied. Due to their usage in solar panels and the possibility for a new type of battery, transparent conducting film is a heavily researched subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option B: Lithium chloride</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium metal is primarily made from lithium chloride by electrolyzing a LiCl/KCl melt at 450 &deg;C (842 &deg;F). LiCl is further employed in automotive parts as an aluminum brazing flux. As a desiccant, it dries up air streams.</li>
<li>To create dark red flames, lithium chloride is also used as a flame colorant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Option D: lithium nitrate &nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium nitrate is a crystalline (sand-like), colorless or white powder or granule.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Acute Akathisia: -</strong>It&rsquo;s a state of inner restlessness which is unpleasant and there is a strong compulsion to move continuously.</li>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>Constantly crossing/uncrossing legs</li>
<li>Pacing up and down constantly</li>
<li>Tapping toes on the ground while sitting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It can confuse for some&nbsp;distress and can be associated with aggressive behavior towards others, or suicidal tendencies thoughts.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> It occurs in almost 25% patients who are on aripiprazole&gt;lurasidone&gt;risperidone&gt;olanzapine&gt;quetiapine&gt;clozapine.</li>
<li>Time to develop: - It can occur within hours to weeks of starting antipsychotic drugs or in case of increasing doses of Antipsychotic medications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tardive Akathisia</strong>: - It takes longer to develop symptoms and persists even after withdrawal of Antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Treatment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the dose of Antipsychotic&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Change the Antipsychotic with lower propensity for Akathisia. Start: - Propranolol 40-80 mg/day, low dose clonazepam in order to reduce symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Other option:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acute Dystonia: -</strong>&nbsp;It is a muscle spasm in any part of the body.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Torticollis: - Head and neck twisted to one side</li>
<li>Patients may not be able to swallow or speak clearly</li>
<li>In severe cases- Jaw dislocation</li>
<li>Acute dystonia can be very painful and frightening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prevalence: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In approximately 10-15% of patients</li>
<li>More common in young males</li>
<li>Prevalent with high potency drugs like Haloperidol</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Time to develop:&nbsp;It can occur within hours of starting Antipsychotics (even minutes, if I.V or I.M route is used).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tardive Dystonia</strong>: - It occurs months to years after the start&nbsp;of Antipsychotic treatment.</p>
<p>Treatment:&nbsp;Anticholinergic drugs given orally, I.M or I.V. depending on the symptoms severity.</p>
<p><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia:&nbsp;</strong>This entity consists of a wide variety of movements that can occur such as: - Tongue protrusion, lip &nbsp;chewing, choreiform hand movements, lip smacking, facial movements (severe) which may lead to difficulty eating/breathing or speaking. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Movements are worse when patients are in stress.</li>
<li>Prevalence:&nbsp;Prevalent in 5% cases, but more common in:</li>
<li>Elderly women</li>
<li>Those with effective illness</li>
<li>Time to develop: Months to years; almost 50-60% cases are reversible.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stop anticholinergics, if prescribed</li>
<li>By reducing dose of antipsychotics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clozapine:</strong>&nbsp;It is most likely to be associated to resolve symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudo-Parkinsonism:&nbsp;</strong>It is characterized by: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Tremor, and or rigidity&nbsp;</li>
<li>Decreased facial expressions, slow body movements</li>
<li>Flat voice of monotone quality</li>
<li>Can be mistaken for depression or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia</li>
<li>Prevalence:&nbsp;In approximately 30%, but more common in:
<ul>
<li>Elderly females</li>
<li>Those with pre-existing head injury, stroke or any other neurological damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the dose of Antipsychotic</li>
<li>Prescription of anticholinergics (for at least 3 months).</li>
<li>Use of anticholinergics to be done in daytime, as symptoms are absent during sleep.</li>

<li>Echolalia is a language and speech disorder characterized by the&nbsp;involuntary&nbsp;repetition of words or phrases spoken by others. This can occur immediately after hearing the words or at a later time. Sometimes, the individual may repeat words or phrases they have heard on television or in their environment. In the given scenario, the patient is seen to repeat the question asked to him involuntarily.</li>
<li>It is often associated with&nbsp;autism&nbsp;spectrum disorder, but can also occur in other neurological conditions such as dementia, schizophrenia, and&nbsp;traumatic&nbsp;brain injury.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A - Coprolalia:&nbsp;</strong>Coprolalia is a symptom of Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome, where the person involuntarily utters socially inappropriate words or phrases.</li>

<li><strong>Option</strong>: <strong> A client with schizophrenia taking chlorpromazine</strong>: The AIMS is used to monitor for extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia, in clients taking antipsychotic medications. Chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic, requires such monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Option a: A client with panic disorder</strong>: Panic disorder does not involve medications that typically cause involuntary movements, so an AIMS assessment is not needed.</li>

<li><strong>Option</strong>: <strong> Reduce anxiety</strong>: Compulsive behaviors or rituals are performed to alleviate anxiety by diverting unwanted thoughts or preventing imagined negative events.</li>
<li><strong>Option a: Control unacceptable impulses</strong>: Compulsive behaviors are not directly linked to controlling impulses but are instead mechanisms to manage anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Option b: Relieve excess energy</strong>: Compulsions are not a response to physical energy but rather an effort to cope with mental distress.</li>
<li><strong>Option c: Influence the environment</strong>: Compulsive behaviors are not performed to manipulate or control the external environment but to manage internal anxiety.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by episodes of sudden, intense aggression or violent behavior disproportionate to the situation. This condition often involves a history of physical aggression toward others or property damage, making these patients more likely to display aggressive behavior in a hospital setting.
<ul>
<li><strong>A patient with major depressive disorder: </strong>Major depressive disorder is primarily characterized by persistent low mood, feelings of worthlessness, and diminished interest in activities. While individuals with this condition may exhibit irritability or agitation, aggression toward others is not a hallmark feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A patient with histrionic personality disorder: </strong>Histrionic personality disorder is associated with attention-seeking behaviors, emotional expressiveness, and a need for approval. While individuals with this condition may create interpersonal conflicts, they are not typically aggressive toward others.</li>
<li><strong>A patient with oppositional defiant disorder: </strong>Oppositional defiant disorder is more common in children and adolescents and is characterized by defiance, irritability, and argumentative behavior toward authority figures. While these individuals may challenge rules, physical aggression is not a primary feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Patients with intermittent explosive disorder are most likely to exhibit aggression due to their history of uncontrollable outbursts and violent tendencies. Proper precautions and close monitoring are essential to ensure the safety of staff and other patients. &nbsp;</p>

<li>Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication.</li>
<li>The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.</li>
<li><strong>DSM-5 Autism Diagnostic Criteria: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts.</li>
<li>Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.</li>
<li>Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).</li>
<li>Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.</li>
<li>These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.</li>

<p><strong>Serotonin Syndrome &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses.</li>
<li>It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS).</li>
<li>Concurrent administration of an SSRI with an monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO- I e.g. Phenelzine), L-tryptophan, Lithium, Opioids (i.e., Meperidine (Pethidine), Buprenorphine) and Buspirone, Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI),SARI, NASSA (Mirtazapine),Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), Amphetamines, Ritonavir, St John&rsquo;s wort, Triptans, Ecstasy (MDMA), Metoclopramide, Ondansetron, or Cocaine can raise plasma concentration of Serotonin to toxic levels, producing a group of symptoms called as <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms of serotonin syndrome</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Restlessness</li>
<li>Extreme agitation; hyper-reflexia, tremors and autonomic instability i.e. hypertension</li>
<li>Myoclonus, seizure, hyperthermia, uncontrollable shivering and rigidity;</li>
<li>Delirium, coma, status epilepticus, cardiovascular collapse and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T/t of serotonin syndrome:</strong> Removing the offending agent and promptly instituting comprehensive supportive care with nitroglycerin, Cyproheptadine, cooling blanket, benzodiazepine, chlorpromazine, mechanical ventilation. [Dantrolene has no role].</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong> is a rare, potentially fatal condition characterized by hyperpyrexia and severe parkinsonian-like muscle rigidity that can occur with antipsychotics.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinuation syndrome</strong> may occur with the sudden discontinuation of all antidepressants.</li>
<li><strong>Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)</strong> are associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. Common EPS side effects are involuntary movements, most often affecting the mouth, lips, and tongue, and parkinsonian-like tremors, rigidity, temporary paralysis, and extreme slowness of movement.</li>

<p><strong>Acute Stress Disorder/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> These disorders are characterized by severe anxiety symptoms and follow a threatening event that caused feelings of fear, helplessness, or horror.</p>
<ul>
<li>When this anxiety lasts &lt;1 month (but &gt;2 days) and symptoms occur within 1 month of stressor, it is diagnosed as acute stress disorder (ASD).</li>
<li>When the anxiety lasts &gt;1 month, it is diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk Factors/Etiology:</strong> Traumatic events precipitate ASD and PTSD. Premorbid factors, such as personality traits, play an uncertain role.</p>
<p><strong>Presenting Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May occur at any age. About 50% of cases resolve within 3 months.</li>
<li>Usually begin immediately after trauma, but may occur after months or years.</li>
<li>Three key symptom groups:</li>
<li>Re-experiencing of traumatic event: dreams, flashbacks, or intrusive recollections.</li>
<li>Avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness.</li>
<li>Increased arousal: anxiety, sleep disturbances, hypervigilance</li>
<li>Anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and emotional lability are common.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Survivor guilt&rdquo;:</strong> A feeling of irrational guilt about an event occurs sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Counseling after a stressful event may prevent PTSD from developing. Group psychotherapy with other survivors is helpful. Pharmacotherapy includes SSRIs, other antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. Prazosin has been used to reduce nightmares.</p>

<ul>
<li>The nurse would most likely administer benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam (ativan) to the client who is experiencing symptoms: The client experiences symptoms of withdrawal because of the rebound phenomenon when the sedation of the CNS from alcohol begins to decrease.</li>
<li>Lorazepam binds to benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel neuron at several sites within the central nervous system (CNS). It enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA, which increases the conductance of chloride ions into the cell. This shift in chloride ions results in hyperpolarization and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane. Its inhibitory action in the amygdala helps with anxiety disorders, while its inhibitory action in the cerebral cortex helps in seizure disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Option A</strong>: Naloxone is indicated for the treatment of opioid toxicity, specifically to reverse respiratory depression from opioid use.</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Benztropine belongs to the synthetic class of muscarinic receptor antagonists (anticholinergic drug). Thus, it has a structure similar to that of diphenhydramine and atropine. However, it is long-acting so that its administration can be with less frequency than diphenhydramine. It also induces less CNS stimulation effect compared to that of trihexyphenidyl, making it a preferable drug of choice for geriatric patients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Haloperidol is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic medication that is used widely around the world. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of haloperidol is for schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome (control of tics and vocal utterances in adults and children), hyperactivity (which may present as impulsivity, difficulty maintaining attention, severe aggressivity, mood instability, and frustration intolerance), severe childhood behavioral problems (such as combative, explosive hyperexcitability), intractable hiccups. &nbsp;</p>

<li>The autistic child repeats &lsquo;sounds or words&rsquo; spoken by others.</li>
<li>Echolalia is a unique form of speech, and if the child has autism it may be one of the first ways in which the child uses speech to communicate. Thus, while it can be described as a symptom of autism, it can also be a great place for a parent or speech-language therapist to start working with the child.</li>
<li>Option A: Scanning speech is a type of ataxic dysarthria in which spoken words are broken up into separate syllables, often separated by a noticeable pause, and spoken with varying force. It is a symptom of lesions in the cerebellum. It is a typical symptom of multiple sclerosis, and it constitutes one of the three symptoms of Charcot&rsquo;s neurologic triad.</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Speech delay, also known as alalia, refers to a delay in the development or use of the mechanisms that produce speech.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option C:</strong> People who stutter may have more disfluencies and different types of disfluencies. They may repeat parts of words (repetitions), stretch a sound out for a long time (prolongations), or have a hard time getting a word out (blocks). Stuttering is more than just disfluencies. Stuttering also may include tension and negative feelings about talking. It may get in the way of how you talk to others. You may want to hide your stuttering. So, you may avoid certain words or situations. For example, you may not want to talk on the phone if that makes you stutter more. &nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Projection is a defense mechanism that involves taking our own unacceptable qualities or feelings and ascribing them to other people.

<li>The given clinical scenario is suggestive of <strong>Wernicke&rsquo;s encephalopathy</strong>, which is a medical emergency. <strong>Thiamine administration 100 mg IV or IM</strong> for 3 days followed by two to three times a day orally for 1 to 2 weeks) may reduce the risk of it progressing to chronic Korsakoff psychosis which is irreversible.</li>
<li><strong>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome</strong> is seen due to the deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine is a cofactor (PP) in glucose metabolism. Thus, starting dextrose infusions before thiamine administration will exacerbate the existing thiamine deficiency, precipitating Wernicke&rsquo;s disease. Thiamine is also involved in the conduction of the axon potential and synaptic transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcohol abuse leads to thiamine deficiency by the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor nutritional habits</li>
<li>Folate deficiency - reduces thiamine absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</li>
<li>Direct damage of the intestinal mucosa.</li>

<ul>
<li>GI side effect: Nausea, vomiting.</li>
<li>Renal: Block ADH (antidiuretic hormone) causes Diabetes Insipidus (DI) (nephrogenic) so, DOC for Li<sup>+</sup> induced DI is Amiloride, Spironolactone.</li>
<li>Neurological side effect (<strong>most common side effect):</strong> Fine tremors 8 &ndash; 12 Hz treatment beta blocker i.e., Propranolol.</li>
<li>Endocrine: &darr;es concentration of thyroid hormone resulting in hypothyroidism (some time causes hyperthyroidism).</li>
<li>Cardiac: Hypokalemia (T wave inversion/ flattening) due to replacement of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> by Li<sup>+</sup>.</li>
<li>Dermatological: Dry skin, pruritus, skin rash, acne, worsening of psoriasis, folliculitis, thinning of hairs.</li>
<li>Teratogenicity: Li<sup>+</sup> is C/I in 1<sup>st</sup> trimester of pregnancy because it causes &lsquo;Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly, risk is 1:1000, so risk of Teratogenicity is much lower than Valproate or Carbamazepine.</li>
<li>So, pregnancy is absolute contraindication for use of Lithium.</li>
<li>Lithium toxicity occurs when serum lithium levels goes above &gt; 1.5 mEq/L-.</li>
<li>Due to dehydration (either due to vomiting or diarrhea), drug interaction- Diuretic (thiazide), levels &gt;2.5 mEq/L sever toxicity and &gt;4 mEq/L hemodialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Signs and symptoms of Lithium toxicity:</strong></li>
<li>Ataxia, diarrhea, tinnitus, dizziness, coarse tremors, abdominal pain, lethargy, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, convulsions/Seizures, delirium, blurred vision, muscle fasciculations, stupor, oliguria (decreased urine output), coma, death.</li>
<li>T/t- Stop Lithium, gastric lavage, oral sodium polystyrene sulphonate or polyethylene glycol solution, S. Li levels &gt; 4.0 mEq/L hemodialysis.</li>
<li>Before starting pre Lithium workup should be done -Blood investigation -CBC to be done, ECG, RFT, and Thyroid Profile.</li>

<ul>
<li>Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic medication commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. This mechanism of action can also lead to the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which include muscle stiffness and tremors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following are the EPS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dystonia</strong>: characterized by sudden-onset muscle spasms, particularly in the neck, face, and tongue.</li>
<li><strong>Akathisia</strong>: a subjective feeling of inner restlessness and an inability to remain still. Patients may pace, fidget, or experience a constant urge to move, which can be distressing. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Parkinsonism</strong>: includes tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. The patient&rsquo;s complaint of tremors aligns with this potential side effect.</li>
<li><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia</strong>: involves involuntary, repetitive movements of the face and body, such as lip smacking, tongue protrusion, and facial grimacing.</li>

<li>Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) include&nbsp;the following:
<ul>
<li>Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months.</li>
<li>Difficulty controlling the worrying.</li>
<li>The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months:
<ul>
<li>Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge</li>
<li>Being easily fatigued</li>
<li>Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability</li>
<li>Muscle tension</li>
<li>Sleep disturbance</li>
<li>Irritability</li>

<li>The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas.</li>
<li>The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause.</li>
<li>Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine that causes less sedation and does not cause dependency.</li>
<li>Alprazolam is a fast-acting benzodiazepine. Alprazolam is most commonly used in management of anxiety disorders, specifically panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.&nbsp;</li>
