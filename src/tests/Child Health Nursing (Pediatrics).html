<ul>
<li>Principles of growth and development:
<ul>
<li>Growth and development are continuous, orderly, sequential processes influenced by maturational, environmental, and genetic factors.</li>
<li>All humans follow the same uniform pattern of growth and development.</li>
<li>The sequence of each stage is predictable, although the time of onset, the length of the stage, and the effects of each stage vary with the person.</li>
<li>Learning can either help or hinder the maturational process, depending of what is learned.</li>
<li>Each developmental stage has its own characteristics. For example, Piaget suggests that in the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years) children learn to coordinate simple motor tasks.</li>
<li>Growth and development occur in the cephalocaudal direction, that is, starting at the head and moving to the trunk, the legs, and the feet. This pattern is particularly obvious at birth, when the head of the infant is disproportionately large.</li>
<li>Growth and development occur in the proximal to distal direction, that is from the center of the body outward. For example, infants can roll over before they can grasp and object with the thumb and second finger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development proceeds from simple to complex, or from single acts to integrated acts. To accomplish the integrated act of drinking and swallowing from a cup, for example, the child must first learn a series of single acts: eye-hand coordination, grasping, hand-mouth coordination, controlled tipping of the cup, and then mouth, lip, and tongue movements to drink and swallow.</li>

Typically, the pain is in the right upper part of the abdomen. Pain usually lasts from one to a few hours.</li><li>Sickle cell crisis:  A sickle cell crisis is pain that can begin suddenly and last several hours to several days. It happens when sickled red blood cells block small blood vessels that carry blood to the bones. The pain can be throbbing, sharp, dull or stabbing.</li></ul></div></div>

It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. When the CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick.</li><li>It is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. Long-term issues include difficulty in breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and infertility in most males. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.</li><li>Craniofacial disorders: It refers to an abnormality of the face and/or the head. Craniofacial differences can result from abnormal growth patterns of the face or skull, which involves soft tissue and bones. A craniofacial condition may include disfigurement brought about by birth defect, disease or trauma.</li><li>Hemophilia is a rare condition in which the blood does not clot properly. Proteins called clotting factors work with platelets to stop bleeding at the site of an injury.

This period is characterized by the newborn's adaptation to life outside the womb, including adjustments to breathing, feeding, and other vital functions.

<li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> in children is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal growth and development. When hypothyroidism is not treated early, it can lead to severe developmental and physical impairments.</li>
<li><strong>Cretinism</strong> refers to the severe form of <strong>congenital hypothyroidism</strong> in children, which results from a deficiency of thyroid hormones during early childhood. This condition leads to stunted growth, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other physical impairments. If hypothyroidism is diagnosed early and treated with thyroid hormone replacement, these outcomes can be prevented.</li>
<li><strong>Myxedema</strong> is a term related to severe hypothyroidism in adults, characterized by swelling and a puffy appearance due to a build-up of mucopolysaccharides in tissues, but it is not typically used to describe hypothyroidism in children.</li>
<li><strong>Acromegaly</strong> and <strong>Gigantism</strong> are conditions caused by excessive growth hormone (GH), not thyroid hormone deficiency. Acromegaly occurs in adults, while gigantism occurs in children due to excess GH secretion.</li>

<li>The <strong>APGAR score</strong> is a <strong>quantitative assessment</strong> used to quickly evaluate the overall health of a newborn shortly after birth. It is scored on five criteria: <strong>Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability), Activity (muscle tone), and Respiration</strong> (breathing effort). Each of these criteria is given a score of 0, 1, or 2, with a total score ranging from 0 to 10. This score is an objective, numerical assessment of the newborn's health.</li>
<li><strong>Skin color</strong>, <strong>reflex</strong>, and <strong>cry</strong> are important aspects of newborn evaluation but are more qualitative. Skin color may be observed as normal or abnormal, reflexes are typically described (e.g., Moro reflex), and crying can be noted as strong or weak, but they do not have a standardized, numerical scoring system like the APGAR score.</li>
