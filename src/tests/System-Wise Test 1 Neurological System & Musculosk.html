<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Ball and socket joint</p>
<ul>
<li>A ball-and-socket joint is a type of synovial joint where the rounded end of one bone (the ball) fits into the cup-shaped socket of another bone.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the case of shoulder joint, the rounded head of the&nbsp;<strong>humerus</strong>bone articulates with the shallow&nbsp;<strong>glenoid</strong>&nbsp;cavity of the scapula bone, allowing a&nbsp;<strong>wide range of motion</strong>&nbsp;in multiple planes.</li>
<li>The shoulder joint is one of the&nbsp;<strong>most mobile joints</strong>in the body, allowing movements such as flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This mobility makes the shoulder joint&nbsp;<strong>prone</strong>to various injuries and conditions, such as&nbsp;<strong>dislocations,&nbsp;</strong>rotator cuff tears, shoulder impingement, and arthritis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong>A hinge joint allows movement in only one plane, such as the elbow joint. It allows for flexion and extension but does not provide the wide range of motion observed in the shoulder joint.</li>
<li><strong>Option C:&nbsp;</strong>A pivot joint allows rotational movement around a central axis, such as the joint between the first and second cervical vertebrae (atlantoaxial joint). The shoulder joint does not exhibit this type of rotational movement.</li>
<li><strong>Option D:</strong>A gliding joint involves two flat bone surfaces sliding against each other. Examples include the joints between the carpal bones in the wrist.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;hypoglossal&nbsp;nerve is the 12<sup>th</sup>cranial&nbsp;nerve that controls the movement of the tongue.</li>
<li>When the&nbsp;hypoglossal&nbsp;nerve is injured, tongue&nbsp;deviation&nbsp;to the same side as the injury is the most common symptom. This is because the muscles on the affected side of the tongue become weak or paralyzed while the muscles on the unaffected side remain functional.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A - Tongue&nbsp;deviation&nbsp;to the&nbsp;contralateral&nbsp;side:</strong>Tongue&nbsp;deviation&nbsp;to the&nbsp;contralateral&nbsp;side is incorrect as it suggests that the tongue would move towards the opposite side of the injury. However, this is not a typical presentation of&nbsp;hypoglossal&nbsp;nerve injury.</li>
<li><strong>Option C - Falling of the tongue:</strong>Falling of the tongue is also incorrect, as this is a&nbsp;nonspecific&nbsp;symptom that could occur due to various reasons, including weakness or&nbsp;paralysis&nbsp;of the tongue muscles.</li>
<li><strong>Option D - Inability in tongue protrusion:</strong>Inability in tongue&nbsp;protrusion&nbsp;is also incorrect. This symptom would suggest complete&nbsp;paralysis&nbsp;of the tongue muscles on the affected side, which is not always the case with&nbsp;hypoglossal&nbsp;nerve injury.</li>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Types of Muscles</p>
<p><strong>Option B:&nbsp;Semitendinosus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Semitendinosus is one of the hamstring muscles located on the posterior aspect of the thigh.</li>
<li>It originates from the ischial tuberosity, which is a bony prominence on the posterior part of the pelvis.</li>
<li>From there, the Semitendinosus travels down the back of the thigh. It inserts into the upper part of the medial surface of the tibia, just below the condyle.</li>
<li>long with the other hamstring muscles, the Semitendinosus is responsible for knee flexion and assists in hip extension and internal rotation.
<p><strong>Option C: Semimembranosus</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The Semimembranosus is another hamstring muscle located deep to the Semitendinosus.</li>
<li>It also originates from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis. From there, it extends down the back of the thigh and inserts into the posterior surface of the medial condyle of the tibia.</li>
<li>The Semimembranosus, along with the other hamstring muscles, is involved in knee flexion and assists in hip extension and internal rotation.
<p><strong>Option D:&nbsp;Gracilis</strong></p>
</li>
<li>The Gracilis muscle is located on the medial aspect of the thigh.</li>
<li>It originates from the pubic bone, specifically the pubic symphysis and the inferior pubic ramus.</li>
<li>The muscle then travels downward and inserts into the medial surface of the tibia, just below the medial condyle.</li>
<li>The Gracilis muscle is responsible for adduction of the hip joint, which means bringing the leg towards the midline of the body. It also assists in flexion of the knee joint.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crossed hemiplegia</strong>refers to&nbsp;<strong>weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, contralateral to the side of the lesion</strong>&nbsp;in the brain or spinal cord.</li>
<li>This feature is typically observed in&nbsp;<strong>lesions affecting the brain,</strong>such as&nbsp;<strong>strokes or tumours</strong>, rather than lesions in the spinal cord.</li>
<li>It occurs due to&nbsp;<strong>crossing over of motor pathways</strong><strong>in the brain</strong>&nbsp;to the opposite side before descending to the spinal cord.</li>
<li>In contrast, lesions specifically affecting the spinal cord do not cause crossed hemiplegia as the&nbsp;<strong>motor pathways within the spinal cord do not cross over to the opposite side&nbsp;</strong>before reaching their respective target muscles. Instead, the motor pathways within the spinal cord control muscles on the same side of the body.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong>Bladder involvement, in the form of urinary retention or incontinence, is a common feature of spinal cord lesions. The spinal cord consists of nerve pathways that control bladder function, hence when affected by a lesion, it can result in bladder disturbances.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option B:&nbsp;</strong>A combination of lower motor neuron (LMN) signs and long tract signs (weakness, loss of reflexes, sensory deficits and spasticity) suggests that both the spinal cord motor neurons and the descending motor pathways are affected. This combination of signs is indicative of the lesion being located in the spinal cord.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option D:&nbsp;</strong>Fasciculations or spontaneous muscle twitches can occur at the level of spinal cord lesions. This happens due to abnormal firing of motor neurons within the affected segment of the spinal cord.&nbsp;</li>

<p>In a patient diagnosed with meningitis, the following would be true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood culture done before the start of antibiotics.</strong>This is important to identify the causative organism and helps guide in picking the most appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients may be&nbsp;<strong>started on broad-spectrum antibiotics before culture and sensitivity results</strong>&nbsp;become available.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) is initiated before CSF PCR for tuberculosis (TB).</strong>In cases where TB meningitis is suspected, prompt initiation of ATT is crucial, even before results of the CSF PCR for TB are available.&nbsp;<strong>Delaying treatment can worsen outcomes,</strong>&nbsp;hence, ATT is initiated as early as possible, when there is a high index of clinical suspicion.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>1 mL CSF centrifuged will have microbial yield of &gt;95%.</strong>Centrifuging&nbsp;<strong>concentrates the microbial organisms</strong>&nbsp;present in the sample, resulting in a higher yield for microbial identification.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong>It would be ideal to obtain a CSF sample before starting antibiotics, however, it is not a must. This is because antibiotics may need to be started urgently based on clinical suspicion to prevent worsening of the patient&rsquo;s condition. Delaying treatment to obtain a CSF sample can be detrimental.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option B:&nbsp;</strong>As mentioned, obtaining a CSF sample before starting antibiotics is not required as delaying treatment can be detrimental. Additionally, ATT must be initiated as soon as possible once TB meningitis is suspected, before CSF PCR for TB results are available.</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong>As mentioned, obtaining a CSF sample before starting antibiotics is not required as delaying treatment can be detrimental.

<li>The symptoms described in the question, including&nbsp;tingling&nbsp;sensation in hands and feet, generalized weakness, easy fatigability, pallor, and ataxia, are suggestive of a neurological condition known as&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy. Several vitamin deficiencies can cause&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy, but the most common ones are deficiencies in vitamin B12.</li>
<li>Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is important to produce red blood cells and the proper&nbsp;functioning&nbsp;of the nervous system.&nbsp;Deficiency&nbsp;in vitamin B12 can cause&nbsp;pernicious&nbsp;anemia, which can manifest as&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy, as well as weakness, fatigue, and pallor. Therefore, vitamin B12&nbsp;deficiency&nbsp;is a likely cause of the symptoms described in the question.
<p><strong>Incorrect choices:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Option a: Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is essential for the proper&nbsp;functioning&nbsp;of the nervous system, muscles, and&nbsp;cardiovascular&nbsp;system. A&nbsp;deficiency&nbsp;in vitamin B1 can cause a condition called beriberi, which can manifest as&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy, muscle wasting, and heart failure. However, the symptoms described in the question, such as&nbsp;ataxia&nbsp;and pallor, are not typical of beriberi.</li>
<li>Option c: Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is important to produce energy and the&nbsp;metabolism&nbsp;of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.&nbsp;Deficiency&nbsp;in vitamin B2 can cause a condition called ariboflavinosis, which can manifest as glossitis, cheilosis, and skin rash, but not&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy.</li>
<li>Option d: Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is important for the proper&nbsp;functioning&nbsp;of the nervous system and the&nbsp;metabolism&nbsp;of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.&nbsp;Deficiency&nbsp;in vitamin B3 can cause a condition called pellagra, which can manifest as the &ldquo;3 Ds&rdquo; - dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, but not&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;neuropathy.</li>

<li>Myasthenia gravis is an&nbsp;autoimmune&nbsp;disorder that affects the&nbsp;neuromuscular&nbsp;junction, causing muscle weakness and fatigue. It is caused by antibodies that attack the&nbsp;acetylcholine&nbsp;receptors on the muscle, leading to a decrease in the number of available receptors and impaired nerve transmission. Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, is a common symptom. The&nbsp;ptosis&nbsp;tends to worsen through the day as more&nbsp;acetylcholine&nbsp;receptors are involved. Patients may also experience double vision, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and weakness in the limbs.

                <p><B>A 16-year-old male visits the hospital as he experienced a syncopal episode during football practice. He explains that while sprinting with the team, he felt lightheaded, lost consciousness, and fell to the ground. He regained consciousness within one or two minutes and did not sustain any injuries during the incident. There is no previous history of head injury or recent illnesses, and the patient has never experienced syncope before. A physical examination reveals jerky arterial pulse. What is the most suitable approach in this case to manage the syncopal episode?</p>

<li>A brain abscess is a localized collection of pus in the brain, typically resulting from an infection.

<li>In contrast, the patient with endocarditis is at risk due to the potential for septic emboli originating from an infective process in the bloodstream.</li>
<li>The patient who has had a liver transplant is also at increased risk because they are often treated with immunosuppressant medications, making them more vulnerable to infections.</li>

<li>Angioplasty gives the best results for medium-sized vessels hence it is preferred for treating the vessels above the knee in peripheral arterial disease.</li>
<li>Angioplasty is indicated in patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps of angioplasty: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Patients posted for angioplasty are given aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (loading dose of 300-600 mg).</li>
<li>During the procedure, anticoagulation is achieved by administration of unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, or bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor).</li>
<li>The femoral artery is punctured under local anesthetic, followed by insertion of a guidewire: The guidewire is negotiated through the stenosis or occlusion under fluoroscopic control.</li>
<li>A balloon catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and positioned within the lesion. The balloon is then inflated at high pressure for approximately 1 minute and deflated.</li>
<li>Once the angioplasty is done, dilatation is confirmed by performing an angiogram.</li>
