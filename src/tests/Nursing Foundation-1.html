Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm of Hg. In this 120 mm of Hg is the systolic pressure and 80 mm of Hg is the diastolic pressure. Here systolic blood pressure means blood pressure measured when left ventricles are in the systolic phase i.e. when the left ventricle is in the contraction phase. In this phase, blood is pumped with the highest pressure in vessels. Diastolic pressure means when the left ventricle is in the diastolic phase i.e., the left ventricle is in a relaxed phase this time blood pressure is lowest in vessels. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Hydrostatic pressure</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is known as Pulse pressure. Pulse pressure is the pressure felt during a heartbeat or we can say it is the measurement of rising of blood pressure due to one systole. It can be measured by calculating the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure. Diastolic pressure is the blood pressure when the left ventricle is dilated or when it is at resting state and systolic pressure is the pressure when left ventricle contracts and due to this contraction blood pressure is increased. A pulse is formed due to this rise of systolic pressure and we can feel it by palpation of an artery. For example, if one patient is having blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg. Then pulse pressure will be the difference between these two pressures that are 60 mm Hg. </li><li>High blood pressure or hypertension is defined as when blood pressure is increased. </li><li>Low blood pressure or hypotension is defined as when blood pressure is decreased. </li><li>Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid on its wall.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<li>The most suitable position for giving an enema is the left lateral position. When a nurse administers the enema, it goes to the colon and we know that colon is situated in the left side. When a nurse positions the patient in the left lateral position it will be comfortable and easy to administration because of colon at a natural downward slant allowing gravity to pull the fluid higher into the bowel. This will result in an enema that is both more effective and comfortable than other positions.</li>

Mishel began her research into uncertainty, the concept had not been applied in the health and illness context. Her original Uncertainty in Illness Theory (Mishel, 1988) drew from existing information-processing models (Warburton, 1979) and personality research (Budner, 1962) from psychology that characterized uncertainty as a cognitive state resulting from insufficient cues with which to form a cognitive schema or internal representation of a situation or event. Mishel attributes the underlying stress-appraisal-coping-adaptation framework in the original theory to the work of Lazarus and Folkman (1984). The unique aspect of this framework was its application to uncertainty as a stressor in the context of illness, a particularly meaningful proposal for nursing. </li><li>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid.

<ul>
<li>The immediate action for a <strong>heat stroke</strong> victim is to <strong>remove them from the hot environment</strong> as the first priority. Heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails, and the body temperature rises to dangerous levels (usually above 104&deg;F or 40&deg;C). Immediate cooling and intervention are critical to prevent organ damage and death.</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s the sequence of actions in the management of heat stroke:
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove the victim from the hot environment</strong>: Get the person to a cooler, shaded area as soon as possible to stop further heat exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Cool the body rapidly</strong>: This can be done by fanning the person or applying cold packs to the armpits, neck, and groin area, or even spraying water and using ice for rapid cooling.</li>
<li><strong>Give oral fluids (only if the person is conscious and able to swallow)</strong>: Hydration is important, but the priority is to cool the body first and foremost.</li>
<li><strong>Call for emergency medical help immediately</strong>: Heat stroke is a medical emergency that requires prompt professional treatment, including possible intravenous fluids, and other medical interventions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why the other options are less appropriate as initial actions:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Give oral fluids</strong>: This can be helpful if the person is conscious and alert, but the first action should be to remove them from the hot environment and begin cooling. If the person is confused, unconscious, or having difficulty swallowing, giving fluids could pose a risk of choking.</li>
<li><strong>Fanning of victim</strong>: Fanning is an effective method of cooling, but it should be done after removing the victim from the hot environment. It should not be the first action.</li>
<li><strong>Spraying water over the victim</strong>: While spraying water and applying cool compresses can be helpful for cooling, <strong>removing the victim from the heat</strong> is the most important initial step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the immediate action is to <strong>remove the victim from the hot environment</strong> to stop further heat exposure and begin the cooling process.&nbsp;</p>
