<ul>
<li>Combined oral Contraceptive pill (Mala N)</li>

<li>Male Sterilization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) i.e. </strong>72-hours pill
<ul>
<li>Emergency contraception is a post-coital contraceptive for women who had unprotected intercourse. The first dose of ECPs must be administered within 72 hours of the act of unprotected intercourse. Unwanted 72 is emergency contraceptive pill.</li>
<li><strong>Saheli</strong> is world&rsquo;s first and only oral nonsteroidal contraceptive pill. It is a &lsquo;once a week&rsquo; pill with very few side effects and high contraceptive value.

The average length of the placenta is 22 cm and average thickness is 2–2.5 cm. It weighs around 500 grams.

It is usually found in conditions such as low-lying placenta or in vitro fertilization. The classic triad of vasa previa is membrane rupture, painless vaginal bleeding and fetal bradycardia or fetal death. The women with vasa previa deliver through elective Cesarean prior to rupture of membranes usually at 35 – 36 weeks. </li><li>Abruption placenta is defined as the premature separation of placenta from the uterus. It is one of the leading causes of third trimester bleeding associated with fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. It is usually caused due to maternal hypertension, maternal trauma, short umbilical cord and sudden decompression of uterus. The mother manifests with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or back pain and uterine tenderness, fetal distress and abnormal uterine contractions. Cesarean delivery is often necessary for fetal and maternal stabilization. If hemorrhage cannot be controlled after delivery, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required to save the patient’s life.</li><li>Placenta accreta occurs when all or part of the placenta attaches abnormally to the myometrium of uterus. It results in increased risk of heavy bleeding at the time of attempted vaginal delivery. Maternal age, multipara mothers, prior uterine surgery, curettage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the risk factors for this disorder. </li><li>Placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta partially or wholly blocks the neck of the uterus, so interfering with normal delivery of a baby. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<li>Thyroid eye disease (TED) is also known as Grave&rsquo;s orbitopathy. The most common cause of TED is Grave&rsquo;s disease (toxic diffuse goiter), it is an autoimmune disease with three important clinical components:
<ul>
<li>Hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland)</li>
<li>Orbitopathy (affects the orbital and periorbital tissue)</li>
<li>Ophthalmopathy involving exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs) and dermopathy with skin lesions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TED generally associated with hyperthyroidism in about 90% of the cases. However, TED may occur in 10% of cases who have hypothyroidism (most commonly Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis).</li>
<li>Goiter (Simple nontoxic goiter), which may be diffused or nodular, is noncancerous hypertrophy of the thyroid without hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism or inflammation. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter.</li>
<li>It depends on whether nodules are toxic or not. Toxic single and multi-nodular goiter is common cause of hyperthyroidism.</li>
<li>Use the process of elimination, eliminate option (c) and (d) as only toxic nodular goiter can cause hyperthyroidism. TED may be associated with Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis (Hypothyroidism) but chances are very low i.e. only 10%. The most common (90%)</li>

<li>Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?</li>
<li>Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?</li>
</ul>

<li>Each question requires a simple &ldquo;YES&rdquo; or &ldquo;NO&rdquo; answer. Each &ldquo;YES&rdquo; answer increases the chances that someone may have an alcohol dependency. Generally, two or three &ldquo;YES&rdquo; answers suggest heavy alcohol use.</li>
<li>There are various questionnaires used for screening of drugs dependency. i.e. Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) for narcotics (opioids, heroin, methadone), cocaine, cannabis and hallucinogens.</li>

<li><strong>Phlebitis </strong>is a complication of intravenous infusion of fluids which occurs due to trauma or any type of irritant making the walls of the vein inflamed. It is characterized by tenderness, erythema and pain at the site. Therefore, the nurse should suspect phlebitis following an intravenous infusion with specific clinical manifestations.</li>
<li>Phlebitis can be of four types:
<ul>
<li>Mechanical, when movement of the cannula inside the vein causes friction and inflammation.</li>
<li>Chemical phlebitis, caused by the drug or fluid infused through the catheter.</li>
<li>Bacterial, when bacteria penetrate the vein.</li>
<li>Post-infusion phlebitis normally appears 48 to 96 hours after the catheter is removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phlebitis manifests in four grades:
<ul>
<li>Grade 1: Erythema around the puncture site, with or without local pain.</li>
<li>Grade 2: Pain at the puncture site with erythema and/or edema and hardening.</li>
<li>Grade 3: Pain at the puncture site with erythema, hardening and a palpable venous cord.</li>
<li>Grade 4: Pain at the puncture site with erythema, hardening and a palpable venous cord that is &gt; 1 cm, with purulent discharge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fluid overload</strong> is the most common complication seen as a result of intravenous but it is not characterized by tenderness, erythema and pain at the site. It is also known as circulatory overload which usually occurs either when more than required amount of fluid is administered or if it is given at a rapid rate.</li>
<li><strong>Sepsis</strong> is a condition that occurs when the infection spreads in the blood. This infection could occur by contamination at the site of needle insertion or as a result of IV fluid contaminated with fungus.</li>
<li><strong>Infiltration</strong> is seen as a complication of intravenous infusion that involves collection of fluid in the subcutaneous tissue due to displacement of the IV cannula. It shows typical features like pain, redness, swelling, feeling of numbness, hardened and cold area at the insertion site. Moreover, the backflow of blood will also be absent.</li>
