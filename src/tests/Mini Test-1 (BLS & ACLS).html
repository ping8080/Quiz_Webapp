It involves placing a catheter into the marrow venous plexus and administering, crystalloids, colloids, drugs, and blood which leads to rapid and reliable absorption into the systemic circulation. </li><li><b>Sites of choice:</b> Proximal tibia, distal femur, the distal end of radius, or ulna. </li><li>The fluids are administered under pressure because of the resistance to fluid flow from the IO catheter into the IO space. The disadvantage with this route is the risk of <b>osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome,</b> bone marrow or <b>fat embolism.</b></li><li>IO access is superior to the endotracheal route. The American Heart Association does not recommend an intramuscular route for cardiac resuscitation.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>
