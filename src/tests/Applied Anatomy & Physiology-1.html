<li>23 pairs of chromosomes are present in the human cell. There is a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes means there are 46 chromosomes per cell. The last pair of chromosomes, i.e. 23rd called sex chromosome. The other remaining 22 pairs of chromosomes are called Autosomes. These pairs of chromosomes are identical. The last pair is so-called because it is only responsible for the sex of the offspring. This 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, differs between males and females. Females have two copies of the X chromosome, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. If the X chromosome is passed on from male, then the offspring will be a girl and if Y is passed offspring will be a boy.</li>

<li>Axial skeleton consists of the bones that lie around the longitudinal axis of the human body, an imaginary vertical line that runs through the body&rsquo;s center of gravity from the head to the space between the feet: skull bones, auditory ossicles (ear bones), <strong>hyoid bone,</strong> ribs, sternum (breastbone), and bones of the vertebral column.</li>
