<li><strong>Iodine</strong> deficiency causes goiter.</li>
<li>A goiter is an abnormal enlargement of thyroid gland. It develops more often due to the overproduction or underproduction of thyroid hormones or to nodules that develop in the gland itself. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. <strong>Iodine</strong> deficient goiter is the most common type of goiter, encountered chieﬂy in geographic regions where the natural supply of iodine is deﬁcient and goiter develops when the thyroid enlarges in an effort to obtain more iodine.</li>

<li><strong>Pulses</strong> are often referred to as "Poor Man's Meat" because they are affordable source of protein, especially in regions where meat may be too expensive or inaccessible.

<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong> is crucial for calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines, which helps in the formation of strong bones and teeth. A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to bone problems, especially in children. The condition caused by vitamin D deficiency in children is called <strong>rickets</strong>.

<p>Bone deformation can occur due to a deficiency in <strong>calcium</strong>, <strong>vitamin D</strong>, or <strong>phosphorus</strong>. Here's how each nutrient plays a role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calcium</strong>: Calcium is a critical mineral for bone strength and structure. A lack of calcium can lead to weakened bones, increasing the risk of deformities like rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>: Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. A deficiency in vitamin D can lead to bone deformities because the body is unable to absorb enough calcium to maintain healthy bone density, resulting in conditions like rickets and osteomalacia.</li>
<li><strong>Phosphorus</strong>: Phosphorus is also essential for bone health as it works alongside calcium to build and maintain strong bones. A deficiency can cause weakened bones and deformations.</li>

<li><em>Vibrio cholerae</em> is an example of Gram-negative organisms. Gram staining was first described by Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram. Based on gram staining technique, bacteria can be classified into two categories, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. In this technique purple dye and iodine combine the cytoplasm of bacteria and gives dark violet or purple color. Bacteria, which retain this color after discoloration through alcohol are classified as Gram-positive and other bacteria that do not retain or lose that color after discoloration through alcohol is classified as Gram-negative bacteria. Due to losing the color after alcohol wash Gram-negative bacteria becomes colorless and no longer visible in microscope so basic dye safranin is used to visualize Gram-negative bacteria.</li>
<li><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is gram-positive bacteria.</li>
<li><em>Streptococcus pneumonia</em> is gram-positive bacteria.</li>

<li>The reservoir is the place within which microorganisms can thrive and reproduce.</li>
<li>There are various links in the infection process:
<ul>
<li>First link &ndash; Pathogen, is the disease-causing organism. This can be a bacterium, virus, fungi, etc.</li>
<li>Second link - Reservoir: The natural environment that the pathogen requires for survival. Reservoirs can be a person, an animal, or an environmental component, such as soil or water.</li>
<li>Third link - Portal of exit: This link is needed for the pathogen to leave the reservoir. If the reservoir is a human, then the portal of exit maybe saliva, mucous membranes, feces, blood or nasal and throat discharges.</li>
<li>Fourth link - Means of transmission: The pathogen can be transmitted either directly or indirectly. Direct transmission requires close association with the infected host but not necessarily physical contact. Indirect transmission requires a vector, such as an animal or insect.</li>
<li>Fifth link - Portal of entry: The entry of the pathogen can take place in one of three ways: penetration, inhalation, or ingestion. The level and severity of infection may depend on the depth of penetration.</li>

<ul>
<li>Incineration is considered the most effective method for disposing of hospital waste, especially <strong>infectious and hazardous waste</strong>, for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete destruction</strong>: Incineration involves burning waste at high temperatures, which effectively destroys harmful microorganisms, pathogens, and toxic substances, making the waste non-hazardous and reducing the risk of infections.</li>
<li><strong>Volume reduction</strong>: It significantly reduces the volume of waste, making it easier to manage and store.</li>
<li><strong>Safe disposal</strong>: For medical waste that may contain blood, body fluids, or sharps, incineration ensures that pathogens are completely eradicated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Recycling</strong>: While recycling is valuable for some types of waste, it is not suitable for hospital waste, which often contains biological, chemical, or hazardous materials that cannot be safely recycled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Composting</strong>: Composting is generally used for organic waste, not for hospital waste, which may contain harmful pathogens and chemicals.</li>
<li><strong>Dumping</strong>: Dumping waste, especially hospital waste, is an unsafe method as it poses significant environmental and public health risks due to contamination and the spread of infections. used to screen for syphilis, not diphtheria.</li>

These antibodies (IgE) bind to mast cells and basophils which contain histamine granules that are released in the reaction and cause inflammation. Type 1 reactions are also known as IgE mediated hypersensitivity reactions. It can be seen in bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic conjunctivitis and anaphylactic shock.</li><li>Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction also known as cell-mediated hypersensitivity or delayed type of hypersensitivity is the T lymphocytes-mediated destruction of cells along with dendritic cells, macrophages and cytokines playing major roles.</li><li>Type 2 or Cytotoxic mediated response is IgG and IgM mediated against cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins. The immunoglobulins involved in this type of reaction damage cells by activating the complement system or by phagocytosis. Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions can be seen in immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune neutropenia.</li><li>Type 3 or Immunocomplex Reactions are mediated by IgM and IgG antibodies that react with soluble antigens forming antigen - antibody complexes. The complement system gets activated and releases chemotactic agents that attract Neutrophils and cause inflammation and tissue damage as seen in vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. It can be also seen in serum sickness.</li></ul></div></div>

                <div class="options">
                    <h4>Options:</h4>
                    <ul>
            <li>1. Fumarate</li><li>2. Oxaloacetate</li><li>3. Alpha-keto glutarate</li><li>4. Malate</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>Ammonia is toxic to CNs; because it reacts with α-keto glutarate to form glutamate. Glutamate is derived from α-keto glutarate by the addition of NH 4 + via the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction or by transamination. The resulting depletion of levels of α-keto glutarate then impairs function of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in neurons.</li><li>Ammonia intoxication symptoms: Blurred vision, tremor, slurred speech, coma, and, ultimately death.</li><li>The normal traces of ammonia in peripheral blood: 10 - 20 μg/dL.</li></ul></div></div>
