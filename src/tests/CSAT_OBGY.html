However, it is generally considered a high-risk option due to potential harm to the fetus and the risk of preterm labor. </li><li>Hormonal therapy:</b> Hormonal therapy, such as GnRH agonists, which are commonly used to shrink fibroids, is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus. It can cause hormonal imbalances and may lead to miscarriage or birth defects.</li><li>Radiation therapy:</b> Radiation therapy is never used to treat uterine fibroids during pregnancy due to the significant risk it poses to the developing fetus.

While infusing, the nurse must assess the following:</li><li><strong>FHR pattern -</strong> Before induction, the nurse determines whether the FHR and patterns are reassuring. The FHR is charted in the labor record at least every 15 minutes during the first stage of labor and every 5 minutes during the second stage (Option-2).</li><li><strong>Contraction pattern - </strong>The nurse also monitors for contraction patterns that may lead to decreased placental perfusion. More than 5 contractions in 10 minutes or a series of single contractions lasting more than 2 minutes (tachysystole) may lead to reduced placental exchange and non-reassuring FHR patterns (Option-5).</li><li><strong>Vital signs -</strong> The client&rsquo;s blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are taken every 30 minutes or with each oxytocin dose change to identify changes from baseline (Option-1). Oxytocin infusion can cause hypotension.</li><li><strong>Intake and output -</strong> Oxytocin infusion has an antidiuretic effect and can cause water intoxication; this results in dilutional hyponatremia and seizure risk. Urine output should be at least 120 mL every 4 hours. Recording intake and output identifies fluid retention, which precedes water intoxication (Option-3).</li><li><strong>Cervical dilation -</strong> The rate of oxytocin infusion may be gradually reduced when the client is in the active phase of labor, about 5-6 cm of cervical dilation. Oxytocin may be stopped or reduced after the client&rsquo;s membranes rupture (Option-6).</li><li><strong>Option-4:</strong> Regular assessment of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) (e.g., knee reflexes) is necessary for clients receiving a magnesium sulfate infusion. Loss of DTRs is an adverse effect of magnesium sulfate caused by central nervous system depression. Oxytocin is a uterine stimulant and does not have this effect.</li></ul></body></html></li></ul></div></div>

The client has an increased risk of infection due to her prolonged labor, which involved multiple cervical examinations.

Other signs of endometrial infection are maternal fever, tachycardia, and uterine pain/tenderness.</li><li><b>Option-a:</b> Palpation of the postpartum uterine fundus is commonly uncomfortable for the client. If the client complains of increasing pain, further evaluation is needed.</li><li><b>Option-c:</b> Major signs and symptoms of endometrial infection include temperature above 100.4°F (38.0°C); chills; malaise; excessive uterine tenderness; and purulent, foul-smelling lochia.

Here&rsquo;s a more detailed scientific rationale for the choice of a) Achalasia cardia / Esophageal atresia:</li></ul><p><strong>Pathophysiology of Hydramnios:</strong></p><ul><li>Hydramnios is characterized by an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, usually defined as an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of &ge; 25 cm or a single vertical pocket (SVP) of fluid measuring &ge; 8 cm.</li><li>The accumulation of amniotic fluid is largely due to the fetus&rsquo;s ability to produce urine and the ability to swallow and absorb the fluid.</li></ul><p><strong>Esophageal Atresia:</strong></p><ul><li>In esophageal atresia, the esophagus ends in a blind pouch and does not connect to the stomach. This congenital anomaly prevents the fetus from swallowing amniotic fluid, leading to a buildup of fluid in the amniotic sac.</li><li>The inability to ingest fluid contributes to an increased volume of amniotic fluid, resulting in hydramnios. Studies indicate that esophageal atresia is one of the primary congenital anomalies associated with this condition (Hernandez et al., 2017).</li></ul><p><strong>Achalasia Cardia:</strong></p><ul><li>Although less common in neonates than esophageal atresia, achalasia can occur and lead to swallowing difficulties. It is characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, leading to food and liquid accumulation in the esophagus, which can potentially contribute to hydramnios due to impaired swallowing and subsequent fluid retention.</li></ul><p><strong>Distractors:</strong></p><ul><li>Kidney Disorders (<strong>Option B:</strong>: Conditions like renal agenesis or dysplasia often lead to oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid) due to decreased fetal urine output. This is a classic example of how renal abnormalities are linked to insufficient amniotic fluid rather than an excess.</li><li>Diabetes Mellitus (<strong>Option C:</strong>: While maternal diabetes can lead to polyhydramnios due to increased fetal urination, it is not typically linked to hydramnios. The fetal kidneys may produce more urine in response to elevated glucoses, increasing fluid volume rather than decreasing it.</li><li>PIH/Cardiac Defects (<strong>Option D:</strong>: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and certain cardiac defects can lead to oligohydramnios due to placental insufficiency or fetal distress but are not directly linked to hydramnios.</li></ul></body></html></li></ul></div></div>

Progesterone pill only</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><b>Progesterone Pill Only:</b> The progesterone-only pill (also known as the mini-pill) is particularly effective in managing hirsutism and acne.<ul ><li><b>Mechanism of Action:</b> The progesterone in these pills helps to lower androgens in the body. High androgens are often associated with hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and acne. By reducing these hormones, the progesterone-only pill can help alleviate symptoms associated with these conditions. </li><li><b>Clinical Evidence:</b> Studies have shown that contraceptive methods containing progestins, particularly those with anti-androgenic properties (like cyproterone acetate in combination contraceptives), can improve both hirsutism and acne outcomes in women with hyperandrogenism. Although this specific formulation is not the sole option, the mini-pill is favoured postpartum for its safety profile and efficacy in women who are breastfeeding. </li></ul><p><b>Distractors:</b><ul ><li><b>Levonorgestrel IUD:</b> The Levonorgestrel IUD provides effective contraception and can reduce menstrual bleeding. However, it does not have a direct impact on hirsutism or acne treatment. While it may help regulate menstrual cycles, it is not primarily indicated for addressing hyperandrogenism-related symptoms. </li><li><b>Condom:</b> Condoms are effective for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections but do not have hormonal effects. Therefore, they do not treat hirsutism or acne. </li><li><b>Depo-Provera:</b> Depo-Provera is a contraceptive injection that contains medroxyprogesterone acetate. While it can effectively prevent pregnancy, its use has been associated with potential weight gain and hormonal changes that may sometimes exacerbate acne in certain individuals. It does not specifically target the treatment of hirsutism.  </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

During this stage, the mother is actively pushing to help deliver the baby. The Valsalva maneuver, which involves taking a deep breath and pushing while holding the breath, is commonly used during this stage to assist with pushing efforts.</li></ul><p><b>Options for why the other choices are incorrect:</b><ul ><li>Monitoring fetal heart rate:</b> While monitoring fetal heart rate is essential throughout labor and delivery to assess the well-being of the baby, it is not specifically a management technique for the second stage of labor. Fetal heart rate monitoring is typically performed continuously or intermittently throughout labor. </li><li>Perineal massage:</b> Perineal massage is a technique often recommended during the prenatal period to help prevent perineal trauma and reduce the risk of perineal tears during childbirth. While it can be beneficial, it is not specifically a management technique for the second stage of labor, which primarily involves pushing to deliver the baby. </li><li>Emergency C-section:</b> Emergency C-section may be necessary in certain situations during labor and delivery, such as fetal distress or maternal complications. However, it is not a routine management option for the second stage of labor. It is typically considered if there are complications that necessitate immediate delivery or if vaginal delivery is not progressing safely.  </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Ectopic Pregnancy</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The clinical signs of abdominal pain, tenderness, and fetal distress at 32 weeks of gestation is suggestive of abruptio placenta, premature separation of placenta from the uterus. On examination, the uterus is tender. </li><li>Given the symptoms described, the condition most likely to be suspected is:</b> Abruptio placenta</li><li>Abruptio placenta, also known as placental abruption, is a serious obstetric complication characterized by the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. It can result in abdominal pain, tenderness, and fetal distress due to disruption of the placental blood supply, leading to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the fetus.</li><li>Symptoms of abruptio placenta can vary depending on the extent of placental separation and may include abdominal pain or tenderness, vaginal bleeding (which may be concealed if the blood is trapped behind the placenta), uterine contractions, and signs of fetal distress such as decreased fetal movement or abnormal fetal heart rate patterns.</li></ul><p><b>Options for why the other choices are incorrect:</b><ul ><li>Placenta previa:</b> Placenta previa involves the implantation of the placenta in the lower segment of the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervix. It typically presents with painless vaginal bleeding in the second or third trimester. While fetal distress can occur in severe cases of placenta previa, abdominal pain and tenderness are less common features.</li><li>Abortion:</b> Abortion refers to the termination of pregnancy before the fetus is viable. While abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are common symptoms of abortion, fetal distress is not typically associated with abortion in the context described. </li><li>Ectopic Pregnancy:</b> Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. While ectopic pregnancy can present with abdominal pain and tenderness, as well as signs of intra-abdominal bleeding, it is less likely in a pregnant woman at 32-weeks of gestation, as most ectopic pregnancies are diagnosed earlier in the first trimester. Additionally, fetal distress would not be expected in ectopic pregnancy, as the fetus is not located within the uterus.  </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

The stress on the cardiovascular system can trigger early contractions and premature birth, posing risks to both the mother and the baby.</li></ul><p><b>Rationale for other options:</b><ul ><li><b>Hyperthyroidism:</b> While hyperthyroidism can complicate pregnancy and pose risks to maternal and fetal health, it’s not directly related to heart diseases during pregnancy. However, untreated hyperthyroidism can exacerbate cardiovascular symptoms in pregnant women with pre-existing heart conditions. </li><li><b>Gestational diabetes:</b> Gestational diabetes is a metabolic disorder that can lead to complications during pregnancy, but it’s not specifically associated with heart diseases during pregnancy. However, gestational diabetes can contribute to long-term cardiovascular risk factors in both the mother and the child. </li><li><b>Placental abruption:</b> Placental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication where the placenta separates from the uterus before delivery. While it can lead to maternal hemorrhage and fetal distress, it’s not directly caused by heart diseases during pregnancy. However, certain heart conditions can increase the risk of placental abruption due to compromised maternal circulation. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Birth will require a neonatal resuscitation team capable of endotracheal intubation and suctioning. Endotracheal suctioning is indicated if the baby has depressed respirations, decreased muscle tone, or heart rate <100/min. </li><li><b>Option-a:</b> Bloody show is usually pink and is described as “sticky” due to its mucoid nature.
