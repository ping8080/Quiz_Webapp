Repeated culturing of bacterial strains in a culture medium induces them to evolve and lose their virulence, i.e. Bacteria become incapable of causing the disease when injected into the human host. Still, structurally they are similar enough to their wild ancestors in order to awaken the immune response against human Tuberculosis. Such strains are called <strong>attenuated live vaccine </strong>strains. BCG vaccine has been used since 1921 and is undoubtedly one of the most widely used vaccines.</li></ul></body></html></li></ul></div></div>
