Place the client in an upright position</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The nurse should consider placing the client in an upright position as the clinical findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema. This can result from fluid resuscitation for burn management. The upright position can relive lung congestion before other measures are carried out. <b>Hence, option d. is correct.</b></li><li><b>Option a:</b> Digoxin can be given later to increase cardiac contractility.</li><li><b>Option b:</b> Chest physiotherapy is not the priority here as this is applicable during the post-burn management phase.</li><li><b>Option c:</b> Monitoring urine output is crucial however, it is not an immediate intervention required in this case. Measuring urine output can be helpful in determining the fluid volume adequacy for resuscitation. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Insert an oral airway.</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The nurse should consider performing manual ventilation as this will allow to deliver a FiO2 of 100%. Meanwhile the nurse can determine the cause of the high-pressure alarm. <b>Hence, option b. is correct.</b></li><li>Option a: The patient may require some kind of reassurance but this intervention is not priority.</li><li>Option c: Increasing the excessive volume, pressure, or flow on the ventilator may cause lung damage, stomach insufflation or hemodynamic compromise in a patient with ARDS.</li><li>Option d: The patient may require an oral airway to prevent the patient from biting on the endotracheal tube. However, the first step should be the resolution of hypoxemia and finding the cause of high pressure alarm. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>
