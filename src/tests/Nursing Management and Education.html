Delegation is the process of assigning part or all of one person’s responsibility to another person or persons. Delegating is an effective management competency by which nurse managers get the work done through the employees. The purpose of delegation is efficiency; no one person can do all the work that must be done; therefore, some work must be passed on, or delegated to others. However, it must be remembered that, even when an activity is delegated to someone else, the ultimate responsibility for that activity still belongs to the nurse leader (i.e. the person who delegated the activity). Nurse managers need to be able to delegate some of their duties, tasks, and responsibilities as a solution to overwork, which leads to stress, anger, and aggression. As nurse managers learn to accept the principle of delegation, they become more productive and come to enjoy relationships with the staff.</li></ul></div></div>

<li>In this, student-teaching triad model, the teacher teaches the student in a real-life situation by involving patient as well. While planning the teaching plan in clinical context, the teacher adapts a patient-centered approach. All the three, i.e. teacher student and patient are the key participants in this process. The teacher in this case acts like an information provider, role model, facilitator, mentor, assessor and planner while the students act according to their level of knowledge and competencies. For instance, a first-year student may work with basic clinical skills while the advance procedures are performed by the interns.</li>

<li>Strategies are not the main component of curriculum design as the components of curriculum design.</li>
<li>In the context of curriculum design, the major components typically include:
<ul>
<li>Aims, goals, and objectives: These define what the curriculum intends to achieve, providing a framework for what students should learn and accomplish.</li>
<li>Content: This refers to the subject matter, information, or topics that will be taught in the curriculum.</li>
<li>Learning experience: These are the activities, assignments, and teaching methods used to engage students and help them achieve the curriculum goals.</li>
<li>Strategies, on the other hand, are generally considered a part of the instructional methods or techniques used within the learning experience, but not typically categorized as a major separate component in curriculum design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While strategies are important for the effective delivery of the curriculum, they are part of the broader category of learning experiences rather than a standalone component of curriculum design. Therefore, strategy is the correct answer for something that is not a major component.</li>

<p>The correct answer is:<strong> a. Problem Solution Method</strong>The <strong>Problem Solution Method</strong> encourages students to actively engage with the material by identifying problems, analyzing them, and then finding solutions. This method promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and the application of knowledge, making it one of the most effective approaches for encouraging the <strong>maximum use of knowledge</strong>. It requires students to apply what they've learned to real-world scenarios, which deepens understanding and enhances retention of information.</p>
<p><strong>Brief overview of the other options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laboratory Method</strong>: While this method allows students to apply theoretical knowledge in practical, experimental settings, it focuses more on hands-on experience and may not engage as broadly with the entire scope of knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Study Method</strong>: This method emphasizes independent learning, but it may not necessarily encourage the application of knowledge in dynamic problem-solving contexts as effectively as the Problem Solution Method.</li>
<li><strong>Team-Study Method</strong>: Team study encourages collaboration and sharing of knowledge among peers, but it is not necessarily the most effective at encouraging the maximum application of knowledge through problem-solving in the same way that the Problem Solution Method does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the <strong>Problem Solution Method</strong> is the teaching method that best encourages the maximum use of knowledge. &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the principles of health education is credibility. Credibility means the degree to which the message conveyed to the receiver is considered trustworthy determines the effectiveness of health education. Further, some additional principles of health education include:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Mnemonic: Re: Pick MLC (Medico-Legal Case)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Re</strong>-enforcement: Re-enforcement basically involves boosting the morale of learners (positive re-enforcement) or giving penalty for inappropriate responses (negative re-enforcement) through awards and punishments.</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>articipation: This principle focuses on active participation of learners/clients throughout the teaching learning process in order to know their problems and work in co-ordination with the health care provider to solve those problems in a better way.</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nterest: It is commonly observed that people actively listens and attends those things only which are of their interest. Example: A diabetic client will be least interested in the health talk of hypertension as he will be more interested in solving his own problem (diabetes) first.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>omprehension: Comprehension is related to the level of understanding, so, the health talk should be made as per the level of understanding of the group.</li>
<li><strong>K</strong>nown to unknown: It is always preferred to start from things those are already known to the client and then proceed towards the unknown facts as it facilitates better learning.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>otivation: Motivation is an essential element in the process of learning as it acts as a stimulus and results in better learning.</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>earning by doing: There is a Chinese proverb &ldquo;If I hear, I forget. If I see, I remember. If I do, I know, this itself explains that when one does something by his own it is learned better. Example: If a nurse not just listens and see her teacher demonstrating the procedure for giving intramuscular injection but she herself tries it on a dummy, the learning will be better.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>ommunication: While providing health education, the educator must also keep in mind the process as well as the barriers of communication so as to deliver uninterrupted health education.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other options are incorrect as authenticity is living the moment with conviction, confidence and being truthful to oneself. Audio-visual aid is a supplement for effective health teaching (e.g. Flash cards, charts); Manpower is the number of people available for work or service. Although authenticity, audio-visual aids and manpower are required for health teaching, credibility is a prime principle of health teaching.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
