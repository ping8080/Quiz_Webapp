Use only oil-based skincare products.</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li><b>Tetracycline</b> increases the skin’s sensitivity to sunlight, leading to an increased risk of photosensitivity reactions, such as sunburn. Adolescents taking tetracycline should be instructed to avoid direct sun exposure and wear protective clothing or broad-spectrum sunscreen if they must go outside. </li><li><b>“Avoid consuming fatty foods daily.”:</b> There is no proven relationship between diet, including fatty foods, and the development or severity of acne. While a balanced diet is beneficial for overall health, avoiding fatty foods specifically is not required when taking tetracycline. </li><li><b>“Wash the affected areas thoroughly at least every 4 hours.”:</b> Over washing the skin can strip it of natural oils, causing irritation and potentially worsening acne. Washing the face twice daily with a gentle cleanser is sufficient and recommended for effective acne management. </li><li><b>“Use only oil-based skincare products.”:</b> Oil-based products can clog pores and exacerbate acne. Adolescents should be encouraged to use non-comedogenic (water-based) skincare products designed to prevent pore blockage and irritation. </li></ul><p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> When treating acne with tetracycline, avoiding direct sunlight and taking precautions against photosensitivity are critical. Over washing, dietary restrictions, and the use of oil-based skincare products are unnecessary and could worsen acne management.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Antihistamines and decongestants</li><li>4. β-Adrenergic blocking agents</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The prolonged use of corticosteroids, whether systemic or topical, has been linked to an increased risk of developing cataracts, particularly posterior subcapsular cataracts. This makes it essential for the nurse to inquire about corticosteroid use during the patient’s health history assessment. </li><li><b>Oral hypoglycemic agents:</b> While oral hypoglycemic agents are used to manage diabetes, they are not directly associated with the formation of cataracts. However, diabetes itself is a significant risk factor for cataract development, so the nurse should still be aware of the patient’s diabetic status and related complications like diabetic retinopathy. </li><li><b>Antihistamines and decongestants:</b> These medications may cause dryness of the eyes, but they are not directly implicated in cataract formation. However, they could contribute to other ocular discomforts or symptoms, which the nurse may need to address. </li><li><b>β-Adrenergic blocking agents:</b> β-Adrenergic blocking agents are commonly prescribed for glaucoma management. While they can have additive effects in patients with glaucoma, they are not a known cause of cataracts. Their relevance in this context is limited unless the patient also has glaucoma. </li></ul><p><b>Summary:</b> The use of corticosteroids is the most critical factor to assess in patients with cataracts because of its established link to cataract development. Other medications, such as oral hypoglycemic agents, antihistamines, and β-blockers, are important for understanding overall ocular health but are not directly associated with the formation of cataracts.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Use a sunscreen or sunblock daily to protect the skin.</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>Daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen is essential for managing acne rosacea, as sun exposure is a well-known trigger for flare-ups and worsening of symptoms such as redness and inflammation. Sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30 should be applied, even on cloudy days, to prevent skin irritation and protect against UV damage.</li><li><b>“Alcohol-based skincare products help reduce redness.”:</b> Alcohol-based products can irritate the skin, worsening redness and inflammation associated with acne rosacea. Patients should be advised to use gentle, alcohol-free skincare products to avoid exacerbating their condition.</li><li><b>“Rhinophyma occurs only in men.”:</b> Rhinophyma, a thickening of the skin on the nose, is more common in men but can occur in both males and females with severe or untreated rosacea. This statement is incorrect and misleading.</li><li><b>“Metrogel provides rapid relief from large pustules and papules.”:</b> Metronidazole gel (Metrogel) is effective for treating pustules and papules in rosacea, but its action is gradual, not rapid. Improvement in symptoms may take several weeks to become noticeable.</li></ul><p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> For women with acne rosacea, daily use of sunscreen is critical to protect sensitive skin and prevent symptom aggravation. Alcohol-based products should be avoided, and clients need to understand that treatments like Metrogel work slowly and consistently over time rather than providing instant relief.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

When the head of the bed is elevated beyond 30 degrees, patients tend to slide downward, causing the deeper tissues to move while the skin remains relatively stationary. This creates shearing forces, especially in the lumbosacral area. Keeping the bed at a low elevation minimizes this risk.</li></ul><p><b>Explanations for Each Option:</b><ul ><li><b>“Ensure the bed sheets are free from wrinkles at all times.”:</b> Wrinkle-free sheets help prevent pressure points but do not directly address shearing forces. While this is a good general practice for skin care, it is not the most effective measure for preventing shearing. </li><li><b>“Reposition the patient every 2 hours to distribute pressure evenly.”:</b> Regular repositioning prevents prolonged pressure on any one area, reducing the risk of pressure ulcers. However, this does not specifically prevent shearing forces, which result from friction and the sliding of skin layers against each other.</li><li><b>“Keep the patient’s skin clean and dry to prevent irritation.”:</b> Maintaining clean, dry skin reduces the risk of maceration and skin breakdown from moisture, but it does not address the mechanical issue of shearing forces.</li></ul><p><b>Key Points for Teaching:</b><ul ><li><b>Shearing Forces:</b> Explain that shearing occurs when layers of skin and tissue move in opposite directions, often due to the patient sliding down in bed when the head is elevated too high. </li><li><b>Bed Positioning:</b> Emphasize keeping the head of the bed at 0–30 degrees unless contraindicated to minimize shearing forces, especially in patients at high risk for pressure injuries. </li><li><b>Complementary Measures:</b> Highlight the importance of wrinkle-free sheets, regular repositioning, and proper hygiene as part of an overall skin care strategy. </li><li><b>Education for Caregivers:</b> Train caregivers to recognize the difference between shearing and pressure injuries and to use preventive measures tailored for each risk. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Psoriasis lesions in dark-skinned patients often present as raised, well-defined plaques with a purple hue rather than the classic erythematous (red) appearance seen in lighter skin. These plaques may still feature the characteristic silvery scaling. </li></ul><p><b>Incorrect Options:</b><ul ><li><b>“Silvery scales on an indurated, erythematous base.”:</b> While silvery scales are indeed a hallmark of psoriasis, the base of the lesions in dark-skinned patients is more likely to appear purple or hyperpigmented rather than erythematous (red). This description applies more commonly to lighter skin tones. </li><li><b>“Translucent, pearly appearing pink to red papules.”:</b> These lesions are characteristic of basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, not psoriasis. This finding is unrelated to the features of psoriasis in any skin type.</li><li><b>“Honey-colored crusts on shallow ulcers.”:</b> Honey-colored crusts are typical of impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, and not psoriasis.

Neurological examination</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The symptoms described—screaming at night and tossing the head—are classic signs of an earache, which may be caused by an ear infection (otitis media). An ear examination is the most appropriate first step to identify the underlying issue.</li><li>Infants often express ear pain by becoming irritable, crying, and moving their head repeatedly, which can indicate discomfort in the ear. An ear examination is essential to determine whether the infant is experiencing an ear infection or other ear-related issue.</li><li><b>Dental examination:</b> While teething can cause discomfort and irritability in infants, it is not typically associated with behaviors like head-tossing. This behavior is more characteristic of ear discomfort.</li><li><b>Throat examination:</b> Although throat infections can cause irritability in infants, the described symptoms are not specifically indicative of throat discomfort. An ear issue is more likely.</li><li><b>Neurological examination:</b> Neurological conditions causing head movement are rare and less likely to explain the described symptoms compared to an earache. However, if other neurological signs were present (e.g., seizures or developmental concerns), this would warrant consideration. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

                <p><b>What is the primary role of the eustachian tube in supporting the auditory system?</p>
                <div class="options">
                    <h4>Options:</h4>
                    <ul>
            <li>1. Transmitting sound signals to the brain</li><li>2. Initiating movement of the middle ear bones</li><li>3. Equalizing air pressure in the middle ear</li><li>4. Carrying balance signals from the semicircular canals to the brain</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx (throat) and helps maintain equal air pressure on both sides of the eardrum. This equalization is crucial for proper hearing and preventing discomfort or damage to the eardrum, particularly during changes in altitude or pressure, such as during air travel. </li></ul><p><b>Option Explanations:</b><ul ><li><b>Transmitting sound signals to the brain:</b> The transmission of sound signals to the brain is the role of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), not the eustachian tube. This nerve carries auditory information from the cochlea to the auditory cortex for interpretation. </li><li><b>Initiating movement of the middle ear bones:</b> The bones of the middle ear (ossicles) are set in motion by vibrations of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) caused by sound waves. The eustachian tube does not play a role in this process.</li><li><b>Carrying balance signals from the semicircular canals to the brain:</b> Balance signals from the semicircular canals are transmitted to the brain by the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The eustachian tube does not participate in balance or equilibrium processes. </li></ul><p><b>Explanation Summary:</b> The primary function of the eustachian tube is to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with external atmospheric pressure. This mechanism ensures the eardrum vibrates freely, which is essential for hearing. Other functions, such as transmitting auditory or balance signals, are carried out by different structures in the auditory and vestibular systems. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

It is caused by a fungus that normally resides in areas of the body such as the mouth and vagina.</li><li>4. Its exact cause is unknown but may involve an allergic reaction to a substance the infant has been exposed to.</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>Diaper candidiasis is caused by an overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans, which is part of the normal flora in areas like the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. The moist and warm environment of the diaper area provides an ideal condition for Candida to grow excessively, leading to infection. </li></ul><p><b>Incorrect Options:</b><ul ><li><b>“It is caused by a type of bacteria that is naturally present on the skin of older children and adults.”:</b> This statement is incorrect because diaper candidiasis is caused by a fungus, not bacteria. While bacterial infections can occur in the diaper area, they are not responsible for candidiasis. </li><li><b>“It results from inflammation due to irritation caused by prolonged exposure to urine and feces.”:</b> While prolonged exposure to urine and feces can cause diaper dermatitis, which might irritate the skin and make it more susceptible to fungal infections, this is not the direct cause of candidiasis. The primary cause is the overgrowth of the Candida fungus. </li><li><b>“Its exact cause is unknown but may involve an allergic reaction to a substance the infant has been exposed to.”:</b> Allergies are not a cause of diaper candidiasis. Although irritants or allergens can contribute to general diaper rash, candidiasis specifically results from fungal overgrowth. </li></ul><p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> Diaper candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans, which thrives in the warm and moist diaper area. The condition is not caused by bacteria, allergies, or direct irritation, though irritation may increase the likelihood of fungal overgrowth. Proper hygiene, keeping the diaper area dry, and antifungal treatments are essential for management and prevention. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Hand hygiene is crucial after touching any items or the infected area. </li></ul><p><b>Incorrect Options:</b><ul ><li><b>Allow crusts on the affected area to fall off naturally:</b> This advice is incorrect because the crusts should not be left alone. Instead, they should be gently removed by washing the area with soap and water 2–3 times a day to promote healing and prevent bacterial spread. </li><li><b>Cover the affected area at night with a dry, sterile dressing:</b> While covering lesions may sometimes be necessary in specific situations (e.g., severe cases), impetigo lesions are generally left open to air to dry. Routine dressing is not typically recommended unless directed by a healthcare provider. </li><li><b>Keep the child isolated from individuals who have never had chickenpox:</b> This is unrelated to impetigo. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, whereas impetigo is caused by bacterial infections. Isolation from chickenpox-susceptible individuals applies to patients with herpes zoster, not impetigo. </li></ul><p><b>Key Takeaway:</b> The primary goal in managing impetigo is to prevent the spread of bacteria. Keeping the child’s linens and clothing separate, practicing proper hand hygiene, and cleaning the affected area regularly are critical measures. Crusts should be gently removed, and the focus should remain on managing bacterial transmission rather than unrelated infections like chickenpox. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

This disturbance normally elicits nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) directed opposite to the side of water application. The absence of nystagmus indicates a problem in either peripheral (vestibular apparatus) or central vestibular function, pointing to potential disease.</li></ul><p><b>Option Explanations:</b><ul ><li><b>Hearing improves after irrigating the external ear canal:</b> This scenario suggests that hearing improvement occurs due to the removal of an obstruction, such as earwax. It is unrelated to vestibular system function or caloric testing.</li><li><b>The patient experiences severe pain during ear canal irrigation:</b> Severe pain during irrigation is more likely associated with conditions like otitis externa or a perforated eardrum. It does not indicate a vestibular system disorder.</li><li><b>Irrigating the external ear with water causes nystagmus opposite to the irrigation side:</b> This is the expected normal response during caloric testing, indicating a healthy vestibular system. It does not suggest a vestibular system disease.</li></ul><p><b>Explanation Summary:</b> Caloric testing is a diagnostic tool for assessing vestibular function by inducing endolymph movement in the semicircular canals. The absence of nystagmus following water application is an abnormal finding that may indicate a problem with the peripheral vestibular apparatus or central vestibular pathways.

Lice live on the body and lay eggs (nits), which are tiny white structures firmly attached to hair shafts on the scalp or body hair. Identifying nits confirms the diagnosis of lice infestation. </li></ul><p><b>Explanations of Options:</b><ul ><li><b>Review the patient’s history for sexually transmitted infections:</b> While poor hygiene is a risk factor for some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the symptoms described—small red lesions and itching—are not typical of STIs. This option is irrelevant to the presented condition. </li><li><b>Check for attached ticks on the scalp or other body areas:</b> Ticks can cause itching and redness, but they typically remain attached to the skin and cause localized swelling or a visible bite site. This does not align with the widespread red lesions and presence of nits described in the question. </li><li><b>Inspect for burrows in the spaces between the fingers (interdigital webs):</b> Burrows are a hallmark sign of scabies, a condition caused by Sarcoptes scabiei mites.

A daily intake of 1.5–2 g/kg body weight provides sufficient protein to meet these demands while also supporting overall nutritional needs. Adequate protein is critical for collagen synthesis, immune function, and preventing further tissue breakdown. </li></ul><p><b>Option Explanations:</b><ul ><li><b>0.5–1 g/kg body weight/day:</b> This amount of protein is insufficient for patients with pressure ulcers. It may be appropriate for individuals with minimal activity or no additional metabolic demands, but wound healing requires significantly higher protein levels to support tissue repair and recovery. </li><li><b>1–2 g/kg body weight/day:</b> While this range includes an adequate baseline for protein intake, it may not fully meet the needs of patients with pressure ulcers. The upper limit of this range (2 g/kg) aligns with the lower end of the recommended range for wound healing, but a more specific guideline is needed.</li><li><b>2–2.5 g/kg body weight/day:</b> This protein intake exceeds the typical requirements for pressure ulcer healing. While extremely high protein intake might be necessary in rare cases of severe protein loss or extreme metabolic stress, it is not the standard recommendation for most patients with pressure ulcers.</li></ul><p><b>Explanation Summary:</b> For optimal wound healing, patients with pressure ulcers should consume 1.5–2 g/kg of protein per day. This amount supports tissue regeneration, immune function, and overall recovery. Lower protein levels are inadequate, while higher levels are generally unnecessary unless specified for unique clinical situations. Additionally, increased caloric intake is also essential for healing.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

It usually appears in later stages, such as the acute phase, and is often indicative of an infection.<ul><li><strong><strong>Incorrect:</strong> </strong>Fever is not expected during the emergent phase unless infection is already present.</li></ul></li><li><strong><strong>Option c:</strong> Severe pain:</strong> While pain is a common symptom in burn injuries, severe pain is less likely in full-thickness burns. This is because nerve endings are destroyed in the affected area, reducing the sensation of pain. Patients may experience pain in areas of partial-thickness burns or surrounding tissues, but not from the full-thickness burn itself.<ul><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Pain severity is reduced in full-thickness burns due to nerve damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Option d:</strong> Unconsciousness: Unconsciousness is not a typical manifestation of the emergent phase in burn injuries unless associated with other factors like smoke inhalation, hypovolemia, or traumatic injuries.

However, excessive swelling can lead to compartment syndrome, where increased pressure in the tissue can compromise circulation. The nurse should monitor for signs of circulatory impairment, including the presence of pulses, rather than focusing solely on the swelling.</li><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Swelling is expected, but the focus should be on assessing circulation and pulses to prevent complications.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Option c:</strong> Formation of eschar<ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The formation of eschar (a hardened, necrotic tissue) is typical in full-thickness burns and plays a role in wound healing. However, eschar formation does not directly affect circulation, and while it may indicate the progression of the burn, it is less critical than assessing the pulses in the arms for possible circulatory compromise.</li><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Eschar formation is important but not as critical as checking for signs of circulatory issues.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> In patients with circumferential burns (e.g., to the chest and arm), the most important assessment is to check the presence of pulses.

Intubation (either nasotracheal or endotracheal) should be performed within 1 to 2 hours of the injury to secure the airway and prevent the need for an emergency tracheostomy if airway obstruction develops. Early intervention helps in preventing airway collapse and suffocation.</li><li><strong>Correct:</strong> Intubation is critical in patients with thermal burns to the airway to prevent airway obstruction.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Option a:</strong> Carbon monoxide poisoning is primarily managed with the administration of 100% oxygen to displace the carbon monoxide from hemoglobin. Intubation is not required unless there is significant respiratory compromise or obstruction. This condition does not typically necessitate intubation unless there is concurrent airway injury.<ul><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Intubation is not the first-line treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Option b:</strong> Electrical burns causing cardiac dysrhythmias<ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Electrical burns that cause cardiac dysrhythmias require immediate stabilization of the heart, usually through electrical cardioversion or defibrillation if needed. These burns may not necessarily cause direct airway obstruction, and intubation is not typically required unless there are complications affecting breathing.</li><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Intubation is not required for cardiac dysrhythmias due to electrical burns unless respiratory compromise is evident.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Option d:</strong> Respiratory distress from eschar formation around the chest<ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Eschar formation around the chest can restrict chest expansion, leading to respiratory distress. In such cases, the primary treatment is an escharotomy (a surgical incision to release the tight eschar), rather than intubation. Intubation is not necessary unless there is concurrent airway obstruction or difficulty in breathing due to the burns.</li><li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Escharotomy is the treatment of choice for respiratory distress from eschar formation, not intubation.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Thermal burns to the face, neck, or airway can rapidly lead to upper airway obstruction due to swelling, requiring nasotracheal or endotracheal intubation to secure the airway.
