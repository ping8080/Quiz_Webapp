Jakob disease</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>Pick`s disease is dementia associated with asymmetric atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, it is a degenerative brain disease. This degeneration occurs due to deficiency of the proteins which are responsible for microtubules formations in neurons. Without microtubule’s brains, nerve tissue cannot survive and it goes under degeneration. This disease particularly affects the frontal and temporal lobes and results in a clinical picture similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease. Early signs include personality changes, loss of social skills and inhibitions, emotional blunting, and language abnormalities. Onset is most commonly 50 to 60 years of age; death occurs in 2 to 5 years.</li><li>Vascular disease: Vascular disease is related to blood vessels and in this, brain degeneration occurs in the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures resulting from the decreased blood supply.</li><li>Huntington disease: This is also a degenerative disorder but in this brain degeneration usually occurs in the area where body movement and gait are controlled such as basal ganglia. </li><li>Jakob’s disease: It is a fatal degenerative brain disorder. It causes rapid degeneration of the cerebral cortex or the outer layer of tissue surrounding the brain. Jakob’s disease is also known as Creutzfelft- Jakob’s disease.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Delusions of persecution refer to false beliefs or perceptions in which a person believes that they are being treated with malicious intent, hostility, or harassment-despite significant evidence to suggest otherwise. Imagine waking up and thinking that your next-door neighbor was plotting to kill you, or that your spouse had sprinkled some poison in your morning coffee. These are a couple of scenarios that may occur for individuals afflicted with persecutory delusions. Perceiving that someone is out to harm your reputation or sabotage your life are common themes of persecutory delusions.

The word ‘dementia’ describes a set of symptoms that may include memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving, or language. These changes are often small to start with, but for someone with dementia, they have become severe enough to affect daily life. A person with dementia may also experience changes in their mood or behavior. Dementia is caused when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease or a series of strokes.

The specific symptoms that someone with dementia experiences will depend on the parts of the brain that are damaged and the disease that is causing dementia.<ul ><li>Dystrophy is the disease related to muscles and not related to memory. </li><li>Insomnia means unable to sleep and this is not related to memory. </li><li>Dyspnea means difficulty in breathing and this also does not affect the memory of the individual.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<li>Antipsychotic drugs block D2 receptors in the mesolimbic and mesofrontal system (concerned with emotional reactions). Sedation is caused by an alpha-adrenergic blockade. Antidopaminergic actions on basal ganglia are responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have antiserotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), antiadrenergic, and antihistaminergic actions. These are, therefore, called serotonin-dopamine antagonists.</li>
<li>Antidepressants or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are a class of medications that are effective in treating depression. SNRIs are also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as anxiety disorders and long-term (chronic) pain, especially nerve pain.</li>
<li>Some antidepressants are monoamine oxidase inhibitors which elevate the levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase.</li>
<li>Depression of the central nervous system is generally caused by the use of depressant drugs such as ethanol, opioids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and general anesthetics.</li>

<li>IQ is a number meant to measure people&rsquo;s cognitive abilities (intelligence) in relation to their age group. An IQ between 90 and 110 is considered average; over 120 is considered superior. Roughly 68% of the population has IQ between 85 and 115. The concept of IQ was invented in the year 1904 by Alfred Binet. The equation used to calculate a person&rsquo;s IQ score is Mental Age/Chronological Age &times; 100. On most modern IQ tests, the average score will be 100 and the standard deviation of scores will be 15.</li>

<li>General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) describes the psychological and physical response to stress that is the way a person tries to adapt to a stressor. Three stages are: 1. Alarm 2. Resistance 3. Exhaustion.
<ul>
<li>Alarm Stage: The general adaptation syndrome begins when a person encounters a stress or/and enters the alarm stage. The person breathes faster, blood pressure rises, stress pupils dilate and muscles become tense. At this stage, the person is coping ineffectively. Fight and flight responses are there.</li>
<li>Resistance Stage: Person assumes that there are some recourses to cope with stressors and remains on alert.</li>
<li>Exhaustion: If the stressor is of short term, the person can cope and solve the problem. But If the stressor continues beyond the body&rsquo;s capacity, the resources become exhausted and the body is susceptible to disease and death.</li>
