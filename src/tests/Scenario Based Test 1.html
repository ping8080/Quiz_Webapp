Hemoglobin A1c reflects the average blood glucose levels over a period of approximately 120 days, which corresponds to the lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs). A hemoglobin A1c level of 5% indicates optimal glycemic control, as per the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which recommends an A1c level of 7% or below for individuals with diabetes. </li><li>Other factors, such as the absence of DKA or ketones in the urine, do not provide a clear indication of blood glucose management in individuals with T2DM, as these patients are more likely to experience hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) rather than DKA due to the presence of some insulin production. </li><li>The OGTT is primarily used for diagnosing diabetes rather than for evaluating ongoing glycemic control.</li></ul></div></div>

Ibuprofen has minimal transfer into breast milk.</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul><li>Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ibuprofen is the preferred choice for breastfeeding mothers because it has minimal transfer into breast milk and has been extensively studied for its safety in infants. NSAIDs with longer half-lives, such as naproxen, should be avoided due to their potential to accumulate in the infant’s system with prolonged use.</li><li>It is not necessary for breastfeeding mothers to avoid all medications. The transfer of drugs into breast milk depends on factors like the concentration gradient, which allows passive diffusion of non-ionized, non-protein-bound drugs. To reduce infant exposure, medications that are poorly absorbed orally, or prescribing topical treatments when possible, are recommended. Additionally, timing breastfeeding around peak maternal serum concentrations can further limit the infant’s exposure. Acetaminophen is also considered safe for use during breastfeeding.</li></ul></div></div>

                <p><B>A 76-year-old patient is hospitalized for cancer treatment and requires an emergency bowel resection due to a bowel obstruction. Four hours after the surgery, the patient reports experiencing pain. The nurse has the option to follow either the standard postoperative pain management orders or the standing protocol orders for oncology patients, which include all medications listed on the patient’s medication administration record.

<li>A hallmark sign of prerenal failure is reduced urine output. An output exceeding 30 mL per hour indicates that the fluid challenge is effective.</li>
<li>While a rise in blood pressure can be observed, the primary focus is on addressing the prerenal failure rather than solely managing blood pressure.</li>
<li>Similarly, although cardiac output may improve, the key indicator remains urine output.</li>
<li>Tachycardia is often associated with prerenal failure, and if treatment is successful, the patient&rsquo;s heart rate should ideally range between 60 and 100 bpm.</li>
<li>Thus, an increased urine output of 70 mL per hour is the most indicative sign of effective treatment for prerenal failure.</li>
