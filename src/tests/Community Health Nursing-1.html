<li>Secondary prevention refers to early detection (diagnosis) of disease and prompt treatment.</li>
<li>There are three levels of prevention:
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary prevention:</strong> Primary prevention aims to prevent disease or injury before it occurs. This is done by preventing exposures to hazards that cause disease or injury, altering unhealthy or unsafe behaviors that can lead to disease or injury, and increasing resistance to disease or injury should exposure occur.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary prevention:</strong> Secondary prevention aims to reduce the impact of a disease or injury that has already occurred. This is done by detecting and treating disease or injury as soon as possible to halt or slow its progress, encouraging personal strategies to prevent re-injury or recurrence, and implementing programs to return people to their original health and function to prevent long-term problems.</li>
<li><strong>Tertiary prevention:</strong> Tertiary prevention aims to soften the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects. This is done by helping people manage long-term, often-complex health problems and injuries (e.g. chronic diseases, permanent impairments) in order to improve as much as possible; their ability to function, their quality of life and their life expectancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Safe water supply, vector and animal reservoir control, good living and working condition, nutritional counseling are the example of primary level of prevention. &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Holistic Health Model</strong>: Approach to health that acknowledges and respects the interaction of a person&rsquo;s mind body and spirit within the environment is termed as Holistic Health Model. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Health Belief Model:</strong> The health belief model is a psychological health behavior change model developed to explain and predict health-related behaviors, particularly in regard to the uptake of health services.</li>
<li><strong>High-Level Wellness Model</strong>: The origin of the term, &ldquo;High Level Wellness,&rdquo; is credited to Halbert L. Dunn. He stressed that the definition of health should be a positive one instead of health meaning the &ldquo;absence of disease. According to Halbert Dunn's explanation of high-level wellness, it is an integrated method of functioning which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable, within the environment where he is functioning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eight points of High-Level Wellness: ways by which a person can promote wellness includes:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Willingness to face inconsistencies in our thinking.</li>
<li>Willingness to hear and examine the other fellow's viewpoints with an open mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Willingness to encourage freedom of expression of those around us.</li>
<li>Willingness to adjust our own views. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Willingness to make time for unhurried contacts with others when such relationships are essential. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Willingness and determination to give credit and recognition to others when it is due to them. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Eagerness and determination to serve others as opportunities arise.</li>
<li>Willingness to give freedom to those we love.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinical Model</strong>: A clinical model for use in mental health centers. The model presented is an attempt to provide a way of viewing and organizing the clinical process. Major factors involved in the process, ranging from the common characteristics of the setting to basic treatment guidelines, are identified. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Sleeping sickness is a widespread tropical disease. It is also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis, which is spread by the bite of an infected tsetse fly, a <em>Glossina</em> It results in eruption of red sore within a few weeks, fever, swollen lymph glands, muscle aches and joint pain, headache and irritability. It targets central nervous system resulting in personality changes, confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in walking and talking. It is a fatal disease if, it gets untreated.</li>
<li>Sand fly carries the parasite which is responsible for causing Leishmaniasis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A mosquito bite carrying the parasites within can cause certain diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, etc.</li>
<li>Houseflies are responsible for causing diseases such as food poisoning, dysentery and diarrhea. Anthrax is also caused by an infected housefly, i.e. <em>Musca domestica</em>.</li>

It is hard to rely upon insecticide program as there are mosquitoes, which have become DDT resistant, therefore the malaria outbreaks are increasing. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report 2010–2016, there is resistance against four most commonly used insecticides classes, these are pyrethroids, organochlorines, carbamates and organophosphates. There is need to apply effective insecticide resistance management strategies in India. Insecticide resistance can be fatal for the population. There is also an emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes.</li></ul></div></div>

<li>Tuberculosis (TB) is primarily spread through <strong>airborne droplets</strong>. When a person with active TB coughs, sneezes, talks, or even exhales, they release tiny droplets containing the <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> bacteria into the air. These droplets can be inhaled by others, leading to potential infection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water borne</strong>: TB is not spread through water. It is not classified as a waterborne infection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fomite</strong>: Fomites refer to inanimate objects (like clothes, utensils, or furniture) that may carry pathogens. TB is <strong>not</strong> spread via contact with contaminated surfaces. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Insect bite</strong>: TB is <strong>not</strong> spread by insect bites. It is an airborne infectious disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p>The <strong>National Family Welfare Program (NFWP)</strong> was launched in <strong>1951</strong> in India. It was the first major initiative by the government to address population control and improve family health. The program aimed at promoting family planning methods, improving maternal and child health, and reducing population growth. This program laid the foundation for future family welfare efforts in the country.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1951</strong> marks the year when India formally started its family planning program, which has since evolved into various national health initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>1952</strong>: This year is not correct for the NFWP launch. It is associated with the first population policy but not the launch of the family welfare program.</li>
<li><strong>1956</strong>: This year does not correspond to the launch of the National Family Welfare Program.</li>
<li><strong>2008</strong>: By this year, the National Family Welfare Program had already been active for many decades, so it was not launched in 2008.</li>

<li><strong>Smallpox</strong> is the only disease among the options that has been completely <strong>eradicated</strong> from the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched an intensive global smallpox eradication campaign in 1967, and in 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated. This achievement was a monumental success in global public health.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polio</strong>: While polio has been eradicated in many parts of the world, it has not been completely eradicated. There are still a few countries where polio remains endemic, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.</li>
<li><strong>Swine flu</strong>: Swine flu (H1N1) is not an eradicated disease. It caused a global pandemic in 2009, and cases still occur worldwide, although it is now managed with vaccines and antiviral treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Rabies</strong>: Rabies has not been eradicated. While it can be prevented through vaccination, it still occurs, particularly in certain countries, and remains a significant public health concern.</li>
