In the convergent design, a researcher should have two separate sets of data (let’s say, observations and consultation records as a qualitative strand, and quantitative self-report questionnaires as a quantitative strand) of equal importance, collected independently, analyzed independently, and then results from both strands are merged during the interpretation phase.  These two strands should not be connected or influence each other at the time of data collection or analyses.</li><li>An exploratory design is a qualitative research design, in this study researcher explores new facts. This is not a mixed-method study. </li><li>Divergence design is a research study as the name indicates researcher start study but it becomes divert toward quantitative or qualitative study during data collection. </li><li>Explanatory design is a research study in which a researcher explains any problem which is under-researched and this is also not a mixed-method study.</li></ul></div></div>

<li>Cluster sampling is not a type of non-probability sampling; in fact, it is a type of probability sampling method. Probability sampling is also known as random sampling method which means that there is an equal chance for each participant to become the part of the research sample. In this, the chances of bias are also minimized, that&rsquo;s why it is preferred over non-random/ non-probability sampling.</li>

<li>The <strong>first task</strong> in the planning stage of nursing research (or any research) is to <strong>identify and state the research problem</strong>. This is crucial because it forms the foundation for the entire study. Here&rsquo;s why:</li>
<li><strong>Identify and state the problem</strong>: Before any research can be conducted, you need to clearly define what issue or question you are addressing. The research problem guides the entire research process, from designing the study to selecting methods and tools, and helps ensure that the research is focused and relevant. Without a clear problem statement, the research would lack direction.</li>
<li><strong>Review of literature</strong>: While reviewing literature is an essential step to understand existing knowledge on the topic, it typically comes <strong>after</strong> identifying the problem. The literature review helps refine the problem statement and supports the development of the research question.</li>
<li><strong>Pilot study</strong>: A pilot study is a small-scale trial run of the research before full-scale implementation. While it's important, it generally comes <strong>after</strong> the problem is identified and the study design is in place.</li>
<li><strong>Defining purposes</strong>: Defining the purpose is also important but comes <strong>after</strong> the problem is identified. Once the problem is clear, the researcher can define the purpose or objectives of the study, which will guide the research process.</li>

<p>In research, an <strong>independent variable</strong> is typically considered the <strong>cause</strong> because it is the variable that is manipulated or varied to observe its effect on another variable, which is the <strong>dependent variable</strong> (the effect). Here's an explanation for each option:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cause</strong>: The independent variable is often referred to as the cause because it is the variable that researchers manipulate or change in an experiment to see if it causes any effect on the dependent variable. For example, if you're studying how different amounts of exercise (independent variable) affect weight loss (dependent variable), exercise would be the cause.</li>
<li><strong>Free variable</strong>: While the independent variable is sometimes described as "free" because its value is not dependent on other variables in the study, this term is not as commonly used as "cause" in research terminology.</li>
<li><strong>Effect</strong>: This refers to the dependent variable, not the independent variable. The dependent variable is the outcome or effect that is measured after manipulating the independent variable.</li>
<li><strong>Final variable</strong>: This term is not typically used to describe the independent variable. It might be confused with the dependent variable, as the final outcome is what researchers observe or measure.&nbsp;</li>

<p>A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is essentially a testable statement or prediction about the relationship between variables. In the research process, it primarily identifies the <strong>variables</strong> that will be examined or measured. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables to be used</strong>: A hypothesis typically defines what the researcher is studying by identifying key variables. For example, a hypothesis might predict how changes in one variable (e.g., hours of study) affect another variable (e.g., exam performance). The variables are at the heart of the hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>Measuring tools</strong>: The specific tools or instruments for measurement (e.g., surveys, tests, scales) are determined after the hypothesis is formulated, during the study design phase. The hypothesis doesn't directly specify which tools to use, though the type of variable may influence this decision.</li>
<li><strong>Sample to be studied</strong>: The sample, or the group of participants in the research, is not directly outlined in the hypothesis. Instead, the sample is typically chosen based on the research question and the variables involved, but this is part of the research design, not the hypothesis itself.</li>

<li><strong>Survey: </strong>This is one of the most common and versatile methods for gathering data. Surveys allow researchers to collect information directly from participants using structured questionnaires or interviews. It&rsquo;s useful for obtaining quantitative data and is especially effective when you need information from a large or diverse group of people. It can gather responses about attitudes, behaviors, or experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Review of literature:</strong> This is an important method for gathering existing information and understanding the current state of knowledge on a topic. However, it doesn&rsquo;t collect new data directly from participants. Instead, it synthesizes and analyzes findings from previous studies, which is crucial in the early stages of research but doesn&rsquo;t serve as the primary method for gathering new, firsthand information.</li>
<li><strong>Expert&rsquo;s opinion: </strong>Expert opinion is valuable when specialized knowledge or insight is needed. However, this method may not always be representative of the broader population, and it relies on subjective judgment, which can introduce bias.</li>
<li><strong>Television: </strong>While television can provide information, it&rsquo;s generally not a systematic or rigorous method for gathering research data. Information from television is often intended for entertainment or general public consumption, and may not be reliable or comprehensive for research purposes.</li>

<p>Surveys are primarily used to collect data about the <strong>present</strong>. They focus on understanding current attitudes, behaviors, opinions, or conditions at a specific point in time. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present</strong>: Surveys typically ask questions about current experiences, beliefs, or behaviors. For example, a survey might ask individuals about their current level of satisfaction with a product, their current lifestyle habits, or their opinions on a current event. The goal is to gather data that reflects the situation or opinions of the respondents at the moment the survey is conducted.</li>
<li><strong>Past</strong>: While some surveys may inquire about past behaviors or experiences (e.g., "How often did you exercise last month?"), the focus is generally still on how those past experiences are relevant to understanding the present context.</li>
<li><strong>Future</strong>: Some surveys do include questions about future intentions or predictions (e.g., "Do you plan to buy this product in the future?"), but the primary purpose of surveys is not to predict the future. It&rsquo;s more about capturing a snapshot of the present.</li>
