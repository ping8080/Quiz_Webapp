<p><strong>Virginia Henderson's Need Theory: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virginia Henderson's theory emphasizes that individuals have a unique set of basic human needs that must be met to achieve health and well-being. According to her theory, nurses assist patients in meeting these needs, particularly when patients are unable to do so independently.</li>
<li>She defined 14 basic needs that she believed are essential for individuals to maintain health and well-being, such as the need for oxygen, nutrition, elimination, movement, rest, and social interaction.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The goal of nursing, according to Henderson, is to help patients achieve independence in meeting their needs as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option </strong>A) Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a theory of motivation, not a nursing theory.</li>
<li><strong>Option </strong>B) Jean Watson's Theory of Human Caring is a theory of caring, not a theory of needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>The first priority in managing any patient, especially in cases of poisoning, is to ensure that the patient&rsquo;s airway is open, they are breathing adequately, and their circulation is stable. This is a life-saving measure, and the ABCs must be addressed before proceeding to any other interventions. This helps stabilize the patient and ensures that subsequent treatments are effective.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>a) Administer activated charcoal immediately</strong>: Activated charcoal may be beneficial in some poisoning cases, but it should not be the first step. Administering it too early can delay the necessary life-saving interventions, such as securing the airway and stabilizing the patient's vitals.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>c) Induce vomiting to clear the stomach</strong>: Inducing vomiting is generally not recommended unless instructed by a poison control center or medical provider. In some cases, vomiting can cause further harm (e.g., aspiration, injury to the esophagus), and it's not the primary step in the management of poisoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>d) Take a detailed history of the poisoning</strong>: While obtaining a history of the poisoning is important for determining the appropriate treatment, this step should come after ensuring the patient's safety. The patient's life-threatening conditions must be stabilized first (i.e., ABCs), and only then you should gather a history or other details of the poisoning.</li>

<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning is often characterized by symptoms such as confusion, headache, dizziness, and cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin). One of the hallmark signs of CO poisoning is cherry-red skin, which occurs because carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. It can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with 100% oxygen or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>b) Iron poisoning</strong>: Iron poisoning typically causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, metabolic acidosis and shock. It does not typically result in cherry-red skin or cyanosis.</li>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>c) Acetaminophen overdose</strong>: Acetaminophen overdose primarily affects the liver and causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. It does not cause cyanosis or cherry-red skin.</li>
<li><strong>Option </strong><strong>d) Methanol poisoning</strong>: Methanol poisoning can cause symptoms like confusion, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances (like blindness). While it is toxic to the optic nerve and can cause metabolic acidosis, it does not typically cause cyanosis or cherry-red skin, which are indicative of carbon monoxide poisoning.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
