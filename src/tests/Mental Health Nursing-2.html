In the case of a diabetic person eating sweets regularly, this behavior could be seen as a form of denial. The individual may be refusing to accept the severity of their medical condition (diabetes) or the impact that consuming sweets has on their health, despite knowing the risks.</li><li>Displacement is a defense mechanism in which an individual redirects their emotions or impulses from the original object to a safer or more acceptable target. This does not apply to the situation of a diabetic person eating sweets because it doesn’t involve redirecting emotions or impulses but rather ignoring the implications of the behavior.</li><li>Dislocation is not a psychological defense mechanism.

Anxiety typically causes heightened arousal, leading to a “fight or flight” response, which can manifest in physical ways as individuals become more physically active or restless.</li><li><b>Activity decreased:</b> Anxiety is typically associated with increased physical activity or restlessness, not decreased activity. In some cases, if anxiety becomes overwhelming or leads to a panic attack, a person may feel paralyzed or immobilized, but generally, anxiety is more linked to an increase in activity.</li><li><b>Increased emotional lability:</b> Emotional lability refers to rapid and exaggerated changes in emotional states. While anxiety can lead to emotional shifts, this answer focuses on the psychomotor aspect, not emotional lability. Though anxiety may cause mood fluctuations, it doesn’t specifically correlate with psychomotor activity.</li><li><b>Decreased emotional lability:</b> This option suggests a reduction in the variability of emotions, which isn’t characteristic of anxiety.

It is a psychological condition where individuals struggle with emotional awareness and communication, but it does not involve motor restlessness or anxiety-driven physical activity, so it is not the correct term here.</li><li>Anhedonia refers to the inability to experience pleasure or interest in activities that would typically be enjoyable. It is a symptom often associated with depression, not anxiety or motor restlessness. It does not involve the motor restlessness described in the question.</li><li>Distractibility refers to difficulty concentrating or focusing on tasks due to external stimuli or internal thoughts.

Let’s go through the options:<ul ><li>Isolation: Involves separating emotions from thoughts or experiences, a common defense mechanism where a person may discuss distressing events without emotional involvement.</li><li>Regression: This involves reverting to an earlier stage of development or behavior when faced with stress, often seen in children but can occur in adults as well.</li><li>Reaction formation: This is a defense mechanism where a person expresses the opposite of their true feelings, often because they are uncomfortable with those feelings.</li><li>Undoing: This involves attempting to reverse or “undo” a previous action or thought, often to alleviate guilt or anxiety. However, ‘undoing’ is typically not classified under neurotic defense mechanisms but rather is considered a more maladaptive behavior pattern.Thus, ‘Undoing’ is the exception here as it is not typically listed among the neurotic defense mechanisms compared to the others.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on the heart, thereby preventing a drop in heart rate and stabilizing the cardiovascular response during the procedure. It is not given for muscle relaxation or neuromuscular blockade, as these effects are typically managed by other medications like muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine).</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

It is considered a psychiatric emergency and requires immediate intervention, often including hospitalization. </li><li><b>Schizophrenia:</b> Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental illness, but it is not the most common form of postpartum psychosis.
