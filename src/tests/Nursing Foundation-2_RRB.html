<li>A standing order is a <strong>written instruction</strong> issued by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner. It authorizes a specified person (e.g., paramedics, registered nurses) who do not have prescribing rights to administer and/or supply specified medicines and some controlled drugs.</li>
<li>Concept map is a diagram showing the relationships among concepts. Concepts are connected with labelled arrows. The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g. &ldquo;gives to&rdquo;, &ldquo;result in&rdquo;, &ldquo;is required by&rdquo;. It can be used to make protocols or steps of procedure in particular.</li>
<li>Prescription is a written instruction by a medical practitioner by which patient is authorized to take those medicine from pharmacy.</li>
<li>Discharge summary is a primary document communicating patients care plan of post hospital care. The discharge summary includes reason for hospitalization, significant findings, procedures, treatment; patients discharge condition, patient and family instruction and physician signature. It is given to the patient once he/she is discharged from a hospital.</li>

<li>Home health aide duties are: they assist with bathing, dressing and other hygiene needs, in addition to preparing meals and helping patients eat. They may provide simple medical care such as changing dressings, sometimes assist with equipment such as ventilators.</li>
<li>Oxygen therapy (concentration and flow) may be varied in most circumstances without specific medical orders, but medical orders override these standing orders.</li>
<li>Nurses can initiate oxygen if patients breach expected normal parameters of oxygen saturation.</li>
<li>A medical review is required within 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Medication is a responsibility of registered nurse. Patient education about medications is a significant part of a nurse&rsquo;s job. Education empowers patients to improve their health status. Benefits of education are:
<ul>
<li>It gives information about right dose, right time of medications.</li>
<li>Decreasing the possibility of complications.</li>
<li>It gives basic instruction about diet related to medications.</li>
<li>Reduction in the number of patients readmitted to the hospital.</li>
<li>Retaining independence by learning self-sufficiency.</li>
<li>Assessing wound healing progress: Registered nurses assess, treat, and create care plans for patients with complex wounds. Assessment requires skills also which health aid will not have.</li>
