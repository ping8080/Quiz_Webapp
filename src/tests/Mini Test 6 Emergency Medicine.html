<p><strong>Obstructive shock:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is due to a decrease in venous return or cardiac compliance due to an increased left ventricular outflow obstruction or marked preload decrease.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax are common causes.</li>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Other Options:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Option A: Hypovolemic shock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hypovolemic shock occurs when decreased intravascular fluid or decreased blood volume causes decreased preload, stroke volume, and CO.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Severe blood loss (hemorrhage) can cause decreased myocardial oxygenation, which decreases contractility and CO.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This action may lead to an autonomic increase in the SVR.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Cardiogenic shock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In cardiogenic shock, the left ventricle fails to deliver oxygenated blood to peripheral tissues due to variances in contractility, as well as preload and afterload.</li>
<li>Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock. Dysrhythmias are another common cause.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option D: In distributive shock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is relative intravascular volume depletion due to marked systemic vasodilation. This is most commonly seen in septic shock.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Compensatory responses to decreased SVR may include increased CO (increased contractility and heart rate) and tachycardia.</li>
<li>The concurrent decreased SVR results in a decreased preload and may hinder CO.</li>

The nurse’s priority is to notify the healthcare provider and prepare for delivery, as birth may be imminent. </li><li>Transferring the woman at this stage is not advisable, as delivery could occur quickly. While timing contractions and checking the fetal heart rate are important, they are secondary to ensure readiness for the delivery. </li><li>The primary responsibility at this stage is to support the infant’s head and apply gentle pressure to control the delivery.</li></ul></div></div>
