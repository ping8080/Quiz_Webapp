<ul>
<li>In order to sue a person for negligence, certain factors or elements must be proven i.e., duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages.
<ul>
<li>Duty means the nurse owed a duty of care to the patient.</li>
<li>Breach of duty refers to failing to adhere to the standards of care by the nurse.</li>
<li>Causation means the breach of duty directly caused a harm or injury to the patient.</li>
<li>Damages means the patient suffered harm or damage as a result of the breach of duty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A nurse is not using ordinary care and is negligent, if the nurse, without intending to do harm, does something (or fails to do something) that she would recognize as creating an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to the patient/client. In this case, the nurse breaches the standard of care by administering an extra dosage. However, no harm or injury occurred to the patient. Therefore, the client/patient will unlikely to be successful in a lawsuit for professional negligence. Hence, option a. is correct.</li>
<li>Option b. is incorrect as the nurse duly informed the healthcare provider about her actions.</li>
<li>Option c. is incorrect as though breach of duty occurred but it is not alone sufficient to prove negligence.</li>
<li>Option d. is also incorrect as foreseeability refers to whether the nurse could predict that her action could result in harm to the patient. This is not enough to constitute negligence without actual harm.</li>

If an autopsy is not required by law, these oral or written requests will be granted.

The nurse should encourage open communication between the family members, client, and the physician to ensure client’s wishes are heard and respected.
