<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Subtract the dry diaper weight (15 grams) from each wet diaper weight:
<ul>
<li>30 - 15 = 15 grams</li>
<li>24 - 15 = 9 grams</li>
<li>21 - 15 = 6 grams</li>
<li>25 - 15 = 10 grams</li>

<li><strong>Option 1) Check the catheter's position at every shift</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct</strong>: The position of the catheter should be verified at the prescribed marking to ensure it remains secure and properly placed, reducing the risk of complications such as displacement or perforation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Option 2) Keep the tubing near the infant's lower limbs</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The tubing should be positioned away from the infant&rsquo;s extremities to prevent accidental displacement caused by entanglement with fingers or toes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Option 3) Observe for redness or discoloration of the abdominal wall</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct</strong>: Discoloration or erythema may indicate abdominal complications, such as blood vessel perforation or infection, which are critical to detect early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Option 4) Palpate femoral, pedal, and tibial pulses every 2 to 4 hours</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1) &ldquo;Stress causes the body to release hormones that raise blood sugar levels.&rdquo;: Correct. </strong>&mdash;Critical illness triggers the release of stress hormones like epinephrine and glucagon, which lead to hyperglycemia. This is a normal physiological response to stress.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2) &ldquo;During serious illness, the body becomes less efficient at utilizing glucose.&rdquo;: Correct. </strong>&mdash;Peripheral tissues, such as muscle cells, have reduced insulin sensitivity during severe illness, causing elevated blood glucose levels despite normal or high circulating insulin.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3) &ldquo;Insulin reduces the risk of brain swelling by stabilizing cell membranes.&rdquo;: Correct. </strong>&mdash;Hyperglycemia can exacerbate cerebral edema following a stroke. Insulin helps maintain glucose at a therapeutic level, reducing the risk of swelling and stabilizing the blood-brain barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Option 4) &ldquo;Using insulin now can lower the chance of developing diabetes later in life.&rdquo;: Incorrect. </strong>&mdash;The use of insulin in critical illness does not affect the long-term risk of developing diabetes. It is solely used to manage hyperglycemia during the acute phase of illness.</li>
<li><strong>Option 5) &ldquo;The stroke damaged the brain area responsible for regulating insulin release.&rdquo;: Incorrect. </strong>&mdash;Insulin production and release are regulated by the pancreas, not the brain. A stroke does not directly affect the pancreas&rsquo;s ability to produce insulin.</li>
<li><strong>Option 6) &ldquo;The medications given for treatment can cause type 1 diabetes.&rdquo;: Incorrect. </strong>&mdash;Medications like steroids may temporarily elevate blood glucose levels (steroid-induced hyperglycemia) but do not cause type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune condition.</li>

<p>Options <strong>1, 2, and 3</strong> are the correct explanations as they address the physiological mechanisms of hyperglycemia in critical illness and the role of insulin in managing complications like cerebral edema.</p>

Monitoring core body temperature: Incorrect. </b>—While monitoring temperature is important for critically ill patients, it is not a specific priority in managing DIC. DIC involves abnormal clotting and bleeding, and temperature regulation is not directly related to this condition. </li><li><b>Option B. Starting heparin therapy: Correct. </b>—Heparin is used in DIC to inhibit further abnormal clotting. This helps preserve the remaining clotting factors and prevents the cycle of clotting and bleeding from worsening. Heparin therapy allows the body to restore its natural hemostasis mechanisms.</li><li><b>Option C. Administering blood transfusions: Incorrect. </b>—Although blood products may sometimes be used to address severe bleeding in DIC, they are not the primary treatment. The underlying issue in DIC is abnormal clotting, and addressing this with anticoagulants like heparin is more critical.</li><li><b>Option D. Avoiding dairy products in the diet: Incorrect. </b>—Dietary restrictions, including those involving dairy, have no relevance in the management of DIC. This option does not apply to the condition’s pathophysiology or treatment.</li></ul><p><b>Summary</b><p>The correct answer is <b>B (Starting heparin therapy)</b> because DIC involves widespread clotting that depletes clotting factors, and heparin helps interrupt this process. Management focuses on addressing the underlying cause while stabilizing the patient’s clotting and bleeding balance. </li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

Internal bleeding can lead to life-threatening complications, and delays in intervention may worsen the situation. Patient safety always takes precedence over routine tasks like shift handoff. </li><li><b>Option b:</b> <em>Proceed with the shift handoff and mention the drop in blood pressure. </em>—This is incorrect because ignoring the alarm delays potentially critical care. The patient’s condition must be stabilized before non-urgent tasks are addressed.</li><li><b>Option c:</b> <em>Adjust the monitor’s diastolic pressure limits to avoid further alarms. </em>—This is inappropriate because altering the monitor settings compromises patient safety. Alarm thresholds are set by healthcare providers based on clinical parameters and should not be changed for convenience.</li><li><b>Option d:</b> <em>Silence the alarm temporarily and inform the incoming nurse about the blood pressure drop. </em>—Silencing the alarm without addressing its cause can delay necessary intervention.

<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> <em>Reduce environmental stimuli.</em>&mdash;This is unnecessary for managing a T2 spinal cord injury. Environmental stimuli do not directly affect the physiological priorities during the acute phase of spinal cord injury care.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2 (Correct):</strong> <em>Monitor for respiratory complications. </em>&mdash;Injuries at or above T2 can compromise respiratory function due to impaired intercostal muscle activity. Early detection and management of respiratory complications are critical for preventing life-threatening conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3 (Correct):</strong> <em>Assess and stabilize blood pressure. </em>&mdash;Spinal cord injuries often cause autonomic instability, leading to fluctuations in blood pressure. Monitoring and maintaining stable blood pressure are crucial for preventing secondary complications, such as hypoperfusion.</li>
<li><strong>Option 4:</strong> <em>Begin bowel and bladder training. </em>&mdash;This intervention is premature in the acute phase. Bowel and bladder training programs are typically initiated during the rehabilitation phase, once the patient&rsquo;s condition is stable.</li>
<li><strong>Option 5:</strong> <em>Discuss long-term treatment plans with the family. </em>&mdash;Discussing long-term care at this stage is not appropriate, as the family is likely focused on the immediate concerns. Additionally, it is too early to determine the extent of functional recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale for Correct Option:</strong> The acute care phase of spinal cord injury prioritizes life-sustaining measures, including respiratory and cardiovascular stability. Thus, interventions focusing on respiratory complications and blood pressure management are key priorities.</p>
