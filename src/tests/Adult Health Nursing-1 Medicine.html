It plays an important role in various metabolic reactions. The body maintains calcium balance between absorption and loss. When there is much loss of calcium or decreased absorption then the loss of calcium, in this condition body takes required calcium from bones. But due to deficiency of calcium, bones cannot get calcium again and there is severe loss of calcium, so bones become porous and fragile. This condition is known as osteoporosis.</li><li>Deficiency of iron causes anemia.</li><li>The deficiency of phosphorus causes bone diseases such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.</li><li>The deficiency of zinc is characterized by growth retardation, loss of appetite, and impaired immune function.</li></ul></div></div>

<li>Homan's sign is a positive sign that can be seen in deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis is a vascular disorder in which deep veins of the leg from knees to foot is occluded by thrombus formation, due to this condition there is decreased venous return from the foot. This disease is diagnosed with a history and physical examination. In DVT, Homan's sign is positive during assessing physical examination. Homan&rsquo;s Sign test is given by John Homans in 1941. In this test, the patient feels discomfort and pain during dorsiflexion when calf muscles are squeezed in DVT.</li>
<li>Hegar's sign and Jacqueimer&rsquo;s' sign are assessed in the woman during pregnancy. Kerning's sign is used to identify neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.</li>

In the late 1800s, Dr. Chvostek explained that in hypocalcemia, the examiner, mechanically stimulates the facial nerve with the fingertip, it could lead to twitching or tetany of the ipsilateral facial muscles. Hypocalcemia is a clinical condition in which the serum calcium level is going down due to any underlying cause such as disorders of the parathyroid gland or calcium deficiency in the diet . </li><li>Hyperkalemia (High Potassium Levels): Hyperkalemia affects the heart and muscle function, but it is not associated with the Chvostek sign. Instead, hyperkalemia may lead to changes in heart rhythm, including arrhythmias.</li><li> Hypercalcemia (High Calcium Levels): High calcium levels tend to decrease neuromuscular excitability, leading to muscle weakness and lethargy. A positive Chvostek sign would not be present in this case, as high calcium typically suppresses muscle contractions and spasms.</li><li>Hypokalemia (Low Potassium Levels): Like hyperkalemia, hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness and cramps, but it is not linked with the Chvostek sign. Potassium imbalances primarily affect muscle function and heart rhythm, rather than causing the characteristic twitching seen in hypocalcemia.</li></ul></div></div>

<li>Meningitis is an inﬂammation of the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The headache is a common symptom in patients as a result of meningeal irritation. Meningeal irritation results in several other well-recognized signs common to all types of meningitis- nuchal rigidity, positive Kernig sign<strong>,</strong> and positive Brudzinski sign. Positive Kernig sign is tested by, when the patient is lying with the thigh ﬂexed on the abdomen, the leg cannot be completely extended and the patient will experience severe pain.</li>
<li>Chvostek's sign is the twitching of the facial muscles in response to tapping over the area of the facial nerve.</li>
<li>Trousseau's sign is a carpopedal spasm caused by inflating the blood pressure cuff to a level above systolic pressure for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Ortolani sign is a maneuver to assess and identify developmental dysplasia of hip.

Over secretion of insulin</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li><ul ><li>Diabetes insipidus results due to any abnormality in the posterior pituitary gland. Posterior pituitary is responsible for the release of vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH); therefore, if any abnormality in this part will lead to the abnormal release of vasopressin, which causes diuresis.  The causes associated with this condition are— severe head trauma, hypophysectomy, direct injury to the pituitary gland. Therefore, diabetes insipidus is the first common symptom associated with posterior pituitary damage. Other options such as lack of insulin, pancreatic disorders and over secretion of insulin are not related to diabetes insipidus. Lack of insulin can lead to diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by increased glucose level in blood, i.e. hyperglycemia. Over secretion of insulin leads to hypoglycemia or low blood glucose levels.</li></ul></div></div>

Pulmonary embolism is a serious blockage in the arteries of the lungs. This condition is caused by blood clots that develop in the deep veins of the legs. If not treated quickly, these clots can break loose and travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, leading to pulmonary embolism. This starves lung tissues of blood, making it difficult or impossible for the lungs to provide oxygen to the rest of the body.

The medical significance of this type of AV block is that it may progress rapidly to complete heart block, in which no escape rhythm may emerge.

<li>Gout is a metabolic disorder caused by an imbalance in uric acid production and excretion. Hyperuricemia leads to the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, resulting in inflammation and pain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distractors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A degenerative disorder: Gout is not degenerative like osteoarthritis, which involves the gradual deterioration of joint cartilage. Gout results from the accumulation of uric acid crystals, not wear and tear on joints.</li>
<li>A vascular disorder: Vascular disorders involve the blood vessels, such as arteriosclerosis or thrombosis. Gout primarily affects joints and soft tissues due to metabolic dysfunction rather than vascular issues.</li>
<li>A renal disorder: Although gout can be associated with kidney problems (like uric acid nephropathy or stones), it is not classified as a renal disorder. The primary issue lies in purine metabolism, leading to elevated uric acid levels. &nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>It is destroyed by GIT:</strong><strong> </strong>Insulin is a protein hormone, and if taken orally, it is broken down by the digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal (GIT) tract before it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This breakdown in the stomach and intestines renders insulin ineffective when taken by mouth. As a result, insulin is typically administered through injection, which bypasses the digestive system and allows it to directly enter the bloodstream.</li>

<li>The V1 lead is placed at the fourth intercostal space to the right of the sternum. So the answer will be D.</li>
<li>The six lead precordial lead V1 to V6 in combination with other leads, record potential in the horizontal plane.</li>

<p><strong>Electrically shockable rhythms are: -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening arrhythmia where the ventricles quiver erratically, preventing effective blood pumping and causing a loss of pulse and consciousness. Immediate defibrillation is required for survival.</li>
<li>Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) involves a rapid, regular heart rate originating from the ventricles, which can reduce cardiac output and cause symptoms like dizziness or chest pain. It may require medications or defibrillation depending on stability.</li>
<li>Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) is a fast rhythm originating above the ventricles, usually from the atria or AV node, causing palpitations and discomfort, and is often treated with vagal maneuvers, medications, or electrical cardioversion.</li>
