<li>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the most severe form of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). There is a total of five disorders comprising FASD i.e., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), a neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE), and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).</li>
<li>Consumption of alcohol (especially its metabolite acetaldehyde) during pregnancy interferes with fetal development by disrupting cellular differentiation and growth, DNA and protein synthesis, and inhibiting cell migration. The disease is diagnosed based on the history of maternal alcohol consumption, characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.</li>
<li>The characteristic facial pattern or facial dysmorphism include short palpebral fissure, indistinct philtrum, microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, premaxillary zone abnormalities, growth retardation, etc.</li>

<li>Koplik spots are the peculiar spots present on the buccal mucosa and are considered a diagnostic feature of measles in the pre-eruptive stage. It appears one day before the onset of rash and presents as bluish-white spots, slightly raised with a diameter of approximately 2 to 3 mm on an erythematous base on the buccal mucosa. The bluish appearance is due to the collar of dilated veins around the submucosal gland duct, and the white portion is likely due to the destruction of cells of the glandular epithelium. <strong>Hence, option c. is correct.</strong></li>

<li>The given sign is called scarf sign which is performed to assess neuromuscular maturity of neonates according to the Ballard score. Expanded new Ballard score uses physical and neuromuscular criteria for the newborn examination. Both physical as well as neuromuscular criteria have 6 parameters each.</li>
<li>Physical criteria consist of examination of the skin, eyes/ears, lanugo, genitalia, plantar surface of feet, and breasts.</li>
<li>Neuromuscular criteria consist of baby&rsquo;s posture, square window, scarf sign, popliteal angle, arm recoil and heel to ear maneuver.</li>
<li>Each criterion is given a separate score ranging from -1 to 5. The sum of all these parameters is then compared to a chart mentioning the corresponding gestational age for a given Modified Ballard Score (As shown below).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The scarf sign is used to test the passive tone of the flexors of the shoulder girdle. It is performed by laying the new-born in supine position, then the examiner brings the neonate&rsquo;s arm across the contralateral side across the upper chest until there is resistance. <strong>Hence, option a. is correct.</strong></li>
<li>Square window assesses the flexibility of the neonate&rsquo;s wrist. It is performed by gently applying pressure on the dorsum of the hand while straightening the fingers. This forms an angle between the palm and forearm of the neonate. <strong>Hence, option b. is incorrect.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Square window</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm recoil assesses the passive flexor tone of the biceps muscle. This is assessed by measuring the recoil angle after extending upper arm. The examiner assesses the newborn in the supine position, places one hand beneath the neonate&rsquo;s elbow and then flexes the elbow briefly and at least extending the elbow before releasing it. The recoil is noted to which the forearm springs back to flexion. <strong>Hence, option c. is incorrect.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Figure:</strong> Arm recoil</p>
<ul>
<li>Heel to ear helps in assessing the passive flexor tone of the pelvic girdle by testing for passive flexion or resistance to extension of posterior hip flexor muscles. In this, the examiner brings the neonate&rsquo;s foot towards the ipsilateral ear. In preterm neonates, the examiner will come close to touching the heel to the ear. While, the examiner will meet resistance in case of term neonates. <strong>Hence, option d. is incorrect.</strong></li>

<li>Cri du chat syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs due to deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. The syndrome gets its name because of the high-pitched, monochromatic cat-like cry seen in the disorder. The disorder can be diagnosed via amniocentesis during the antenatal period, where the deletion of chromosome 5 is visible.</li>
<li>In the neonatal period, the most characteristic finding is a high-pitched, monotonous cry, which usually disappears within the first few months of life. Newborns also exhibit low birthweight, microcephaly, asphyxia, muscle hypotonia, and impaired suction.</li>

<li>Pneumococcal pneumonia occurs due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, transmitted by droplets. It is common in winters and overcrowding and diminished host resistance predisposes the children to infection with pneumococci. The disease is characterized by headache, chills, cough, and high fever. In severe cases, grunting, chest indrawing, difficulty in feeding, and cyanosis are evident. The diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, X-ray findings, and leukocytosis. The disease is managed by Penicillin G 50,000 units/kg/day given IV or IM in divided doses for 5-7 days. In patients allergic to penicillin, chloramphenicol or cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) can be used. <strong>Hence, option a. is correct.</strong></li>

<li>Corrosive poisoning is seen in children, especially toddlers. Corrosives can be acidic or alkaline. Acids are most commonly found in household or industrial products, batteries, and cleaning agents. The immediate effects of corrosive poisoning are burning at the site of ingestion or spill and hoarseness of voice due to laryngeal edema. Other symptoms are excessive salivation, dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, and epigastric pain. If respiratory system is involved, then it is presented with dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and chemical pneumonitis.</li>
<li>In the given case, airway protection is the priority as laryngeal edema may rapidly progress over minutes to hours and may cause airway obstruction and death. <strong>Hence, option c. is correct.</strong></li>
<li>NG tube insertion and gastric lavage are contraindicated as they increase the risk of injury and perforation. <strong>Hence, options a and b are incorrect.</strong></li>
<li>Endoscopy is an appropriate intervention, however is not the priority. It is performed within 24 hours of ingestions to assess the extent of esophageal injury.

<ul>
<li>The child&rsquo;s symptoms of sunken eyes and thirst indicate dehydration. In addition, the eagerness to drink milk suggests that the child is experiencing fluid deficit and is trying to compensate by consuming fluids. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that the child&rsquo;s condition doesn&rsquo;t indicate severe dehydration, as there are no signs such as lethargy, rapid breathing, or inability to drink. Instead, the child is likely in the early stages of dehydration, which is classified as &ldquo;some dehydration.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Other choices are incorrect as:</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>No dehydration: The presence of symptoms such as sunken eyes and thirst indicates that the child is experiencing dehydration to some extent, ruling out the possibility of no dehydration.</li>
<li>Severe dehydration: Severe dehydration is characterized by more severe symptoms such as lethargy, rapid breathing, and inability to drink. Since the child is described as eagerly drinking milk, without signs of severe distress, severe dehydration is not the appropriate classification for the child&rsquo;s condition.</li>
<li>Normal: Dehydration is present in this scenario due to the child&rsquo;s symptoms of sunken eyes and thirst. Therefore, the child&rsquo;s condition is not considered normal.</li>

</li>
<li>Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of inherited disorders characterized by a reduction or complete lack of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes.</li>
<li>Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which results from the deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD). This enzyme metabolizes tyrosine that converts homogentisic acid (HGA) into malate and acetoacetate. In the absence of HGD, homogentisic acid produced in excess by the liver oxidizes into ochronotic pigment polymer. Accumulation of this pigment in various tissues leads to systemic disease. Dark urine is the earliest and only manifestation of the disorder in children.</li>
<li>Tyrosinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, the enzyme responsible for the final step of tyrosine degradation. The disease is presented with failure to thrive, vomiting, ascites, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia in the initial period. In older infants and children, growth failure, Fanconi syndrome, and neurologic manifestations may develop.</li>

<li>The clinical scenario presents the classical signs of CROUP.</li>
<li>Croup is a common infection in children. It causes swelling in the upper part of the airway in the neck. It causes a barking cough, with or without fever. And it may cause problems with breathing. The illness is seen more often in the winter.</li>
<li>A virus is the most common cause of croup. But the illness may also be caused by bacteria, allergies, or reflux from the stomach. Viruses that are known to cause croup are:
<ul>
<li>Parainfluenza virus</li>
<li>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</li>
<li>The flu (influenza virus)</li>
<li>Adenovirus</li>
<li>Enteroviruses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Symptoms of croup in a child: The symptoms of croup are not always the same. As the illness moves from the nose to the lungs, the symptoms can change. They may include:
<ul>
<li>A runny nose, a stuffy nose, and slight cough</li>
<li>A cough that turns into a &ldquo;seal&rsquo;s bark&rdquo;</li>
<li>Losing his or her voice (laryngitis)</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>A high-pitched &ldquo;creaking&rdquo; or whistling sound when breathing in (stridor)</li>

                <p><b>A child is on CPAP and is hemodynamically stable. Which of the following is the best method of feeding this child?</p>
                <div class="options">

                    <ul>
            <li>1. Breastfeeding</li><li>2. Nasogastric feeding</li><li>3. Cup feeding</li><li>4. IV fluids</li></ul></div><div class="solution"><h4>Solution:</h4><ul><li>While nasogastric feeding (option b) may be a valid method of providing nutrition to a child on CPAP, the optimal feeding method depends on various factors, including the child’s condition and ability to feed. Let’s discuss each option:<ul ><li> Nasogastric feeding: Nasogastric feeding involves delivering milk or formula directly into the stomach via a tube inserted through the nose. This method bypasses the oral route and allows for the delivery of nutrition directly to the gastrointestinal tract. Nasogastric feeding can be a suitable option for children on CPAP who are unable to feed orally or who require precise control over their fluid intake.</li><li>Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is often the preferred method of feeding for infants due to its numerous benefits, including providing optimal nutrition, immune protection, and promoting bonding between the infant and mother. However, in the context of a child on CPAP, breastfeeding may be challenging due to the equipment and positioning required for CPAP therapy, which can interfere with breastfeeding. </li><li>Cup feeding: Cup feeding involves offering milk or formula to the child in a small cup, allowing them to lap or sip the liquid. Cup feeding is a gentle and effective method of feeding that minimizes the risk of aspiration and allows the child to control the pace of feeding. Cup feeding may be appropriate for children on CPAP who are able to swallow safely and tolerate oral feeding.</li><li>IV fluids: Intravenous (IV) fluids are not typically used as a method of feeding unless absolutely necessary, such as in cases where oral or enteral feeding is not feasible or contraindicated. IV fluids are primarily used for fluid resuscitation or to provide hydration and nutrition when oral or enteral feeding is not possible or inadequate. In the case of a hemodynamically stable child on CPAP, IV fluids are unlikely to be the best method of feeding unless there are specific indications for their use. </li></ul><p>So, while nasogastric feeding (option b) may be a suitable method of providing nutrition to a child on CPAP, the choice of feeding method should be based on the child’s individual needs, condition, and ability to feed safely. Cup feeding (option c) may also be considered if the child is able to tolerate oral feeding.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

This condition typically results in elevated blood pressure in the upper body (indicated by the bounding brachial pulses) due to increased resistance, while the lower body (indicated by diminished pedal pulses) experiences decreased blood flow, leading to lower blood pressure. The elevated jugular venous distention (JVD) suggests increased pressure in the venous system, and the presence of a cardiac murmur can indicate collateral circulation or other hemodynamic changes due to the narrowed aorta.</li>
<li><strong>Option (a)</strong>, congestive heart failure, could also present with some overlapping symptoms, but the specific combination of elevated blood pressure, bounding pulses in the upper body, and diminished pulses in the lower body is more characteristic of coarctation of the aorta.</li>
<li><strong>Option (c),</strong> mitral valve prolapse, typically presents with different symptoms such as a mid-systolic click or regurgitant murmur, and it does not specifically cause the upper versus lower extremity pulse disparity seen in this case.</li>
<li><strong>Option (d),</strong> transposition of the great vessels, is characterized by a different set of symptoms and typically presents with severe cyanosis and distress shortly after birth due to inadequate oxygenation of blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the clinical findings in this newborn infant strongly suggest coarctation of the aorta, making option (b) the most appropriate choice.</p>

<p>Opisthotonus is a clinical manifestation where the infant's head and neck are hyperextended, often in response to discomfort or pain. This position can occur as the body attempts to relieve pressure or strain, commonly associated with severe central nervous system irritation, such as in cases of meningitis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hyperextension of the head and neck:</strong> This is the characteristic posture observed in opisthotonus. The infant&rsquo;s head and neck are pushed backward, creating an arched position. This is a compensatory mechanism to alleviate discomfort caused by inflammation or irritation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why other options are less relevant: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resistance during specific leg movements:</strong> This is indicative of Kernig's sign, a diagnostic test for meningitis where resistance to extending the knee while the hip is flexed is observed. It is not related to opisthotonus.</li>
<li><strong>Flexion of the knees or hips accompanied by head flexion:</strong> This describes Brudzinski's sign, which involves the flexion of the knees or hips when the head is flexed. It is a sign of meningeal irritation but does not describe opisthotonus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>A high-pitched cry when the neck is flexed:</strong> While a high-pitched cry can be associated with various neurological issues, it is not specifically linked to opisthotonus. The opisthotonus position itself is more characterized by the hyperextension of the head and neck rather than the quality of the cry.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, an infant with meningitis displaying opisthotonus will typically exhibit hyperextension of the head and neck, which is the most defining feature of this condition.</p>

<li><strong>Barlow&rsquo;s Maneuver:</strong> This test is used to detect developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in newborns and young infants. During the maneuver, the examiner adducts the infant's hip (moves the thigh towards the center of the body) while applying gentle posterior pressure on the thigh. If the hip joint dislocates or moves out of its socket, it is termed "dislocatable," indicating a positive result for DDH. This maneuver helps identify instability in the hip joint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why other options are less relevant: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pavlik&rsquo;s Maneuver:</strong> The Pavlik harness is a treatment device used for managing DDH, not a diagnostic test. It helps keep the hips in a stable and correct position to promote proper hip development in infants diagnosed with DDH. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Gower&rsquo;s Maneuver:</strong> This maneuver is associated with muscular dystrophy, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It involves a child using their hands to walk up their own body from a seated position to stand, which is not related to the diagnosis of DDH. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Allis&rsquo;s Maneuver:</strong> This test involves comparing the knee heights of a child when the hips are flexed and can help assess hip dislocation, but it is not as commonly used as the Barlow maneuver for initial screening of DDH in neonates.</li>

<li><strong>Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI):</strong> Blue sclerae, or a bluish tint to the whites of the eyes, can be an indicator of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones that break easily. OI is also known for causing other symptoms such as bone deformities, short stature, and hearing loss. The presence of blue sclerae in an infant can be an early sign of this condition, especially if the infant has not yet experienced bone fractures. This feature arises due to the thinness of the scleral collagen layers, which allows the underlying choroidal veins to be visible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why other options are less likely: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juvenile Arthritis:</strong> This condition involves chronic inflammation of the joints, which can lead to joint damage and deformity. However, it does not typically cause blue sclerae. It usually presents with symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.</li>
<li><strong>Tay-Sachs Disease:</strong> Tay-Sachs is a severe genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, leading to progressive neurological decline. It does not present with blue sclerae. Infants with Tay-Sachs initially develop normally but then experience a loss of motor skills and cognitive function due to the accumulation of fatty substances in the brain. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Muscular Dystrophy (MD):</strong> MD is a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. While it involves muscle tissue, it does not affect the sclerae and does not present with blue sclerae.</li>

<li>Once hands are in position, compressions are delivered by compressing the sternum with the thumbs and thorax with the rest of the fingers, for adequate counter pressure.</li>

<li>This infant has presented within&nbsp;<strong>24-72 hours since birth</strong>with yellowish discolouration of the skin. This is most likely to be due to&nbsp;<strong>physiological jaundice</strong>.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Levels of total serum bilirubin&nbsp;<strong>peak at around 3 days of age and then fall</strong>in term neonates. These levels are below the cut-offs for requiring phototherapy and hence,&nbsp;<strong>don&rsquo;t require any treatment</strong>.</li>

<p>Causes for <strong>low Apgar score</strong> are: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetal distress</li>
<li>Prematurity</li>
<li>Drugs like analgesics, narcotics, sedatives, magnesium sulfate</li>
<li>Acute cerebral trauma</li>
<li>Precipitous delivery</li>
<li>Airway obstruction (choanal atresia)</li>
<li>Congenital pneumonia or sepsis</li>
<li>Hemorrhage - hypovolemia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>False-negative</strong> Apgar score is seen in <strong>maternal acidosis</strong> and <strong>high fetal catecholamine levels</strong>.</p>
<p>A total score of <strong>10</strong> indicates that the infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with a <strong>score of 0-3 requires immediate resuscitation</strong>.

<li>Breastfeeding is <strong>not contraindicated</strong> in <strong>breast milk jaundice</strong>. Mothers are advised to <strong>continue breastfeeding</strong> at frequent intervals.</li>
<li>Breastmilk jaundice is seen in about 2-4% of <strong>exclusively breastfed</strong> There is significant <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> after the 7<sup>th</sup> day and may last for 2-3 weeks. This may be caused by the breast milk that might contain <strong>&beta;-glucuronidase</strong>, which deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption and other inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase. Persistently high bilirubin levels may require changing from breast milk to <strong>infant formula for 24-48 hours</strong> and/or treatment with <strong>phototherapy, </strong>without cessation of breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breastfeeding jaundice (BFJ) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an early-onset, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of breastfed infants. Occurs in the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> week after birth</strong> (usually <strong>appears after 24 - 72 hours</strong> of birth). It is due to decreased milk intake with dehydration and/or reduced caloric intake. The treatment would include continuing breastfeeding and supplementation with formula feeds if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interesting Fact! &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>"We haven't stopped breastfeeding even once for treatment of breast milk jaundice in the last 15 years!" states the AIIMS Protocols in Neonatology-2019 (edition; Page no -231)</p>

<li>The Moro reflex is a <strong>primitive reflex</strong> that is very <strong>sensitive </strong>to the infant's level of It is elicited by supporting the infant in the semi-erect position and allowing the infant's head to fall backward onto the examiner's hand.</li>

<li><strong>Exaggerated,</strong> stereotyped, non-habituating Moro reflex is a feature of <strong>severe bilateral intrauterine cerebral disturbance,</strong> perhaps because of the release of the brain stem from inhibitory cortical influences. It is seen in conditions such as the following:</li>

<li>Stage II HIE (moderate): Weak/incomplete</li>
<li><strong>Stage III HIE (severe): Absent</strong></li>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> In kernicterus, there is a deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in the basal ganglia and brain stem. Hence, the Moro reflex is absent.</li>
<li><strong>Option C: In</strong> stage III HIE, the muscles are flaccid and the infant is comatose. Thus, the Moro reflex is absent. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Option D:</strong> Erb's palsy results from an injury to the brachial plexus. So, the reflex is absent on the side of injury as the nerve supplying the muscles involved (efferent of the reflex) is affected.</li>

<li>Hypothermia refers to a decrease in the body temperature below the normal range, which can have serious consequences on the newborn's health and well-being.</li>
<li>Preterm newborns are predicted towards hypothermia because:</li>
<li>They have lower brown fat</li>
<li>Their skin is thin, hence more evaporation occurs from their body surface</li>
<li>Their body remains in an extended posture due to less maturity of muscles</li>
<li>Large head to body surface area ratio</li>
<li>Hypothermia in newborns, especially in preterm infants, can have significant adverse effects on their health and well-being.</li>
<li>Identifying the severity of hypothermia is essential for appropriate management and interventions to restore the newborn's body temperature and prevent complications.</li>
<li><strong>The grades of hypothermia are as follows:</strong></li>
<li>Cold stress: 36-36.4&deg;C</li>
<li>Moderate hypothermia: 32-36&deg;C</li>
<li>Severe hypothermia: &lt;32&deg;C</li>
<li>Body temperature below 32&deg;C is the correct definition of severe hypothermia in a newborn.</li>
<li>The newborn is required to be kept in an incubator.</li>

<p>Phototherapy is a widely used treatment modality for neonatal jaundice and is generally well-tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism of action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Structural isomerisation to water soluble lumirubin</li>
<li>Configural isomerisation</li>
<li>Photo oxidation products</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wavelength of 460-490</strong> nm is used (blue light).</p>
<p><strong>Distance between</strong> the child and the bulb should be <strong>30-45cm.</strong></p>
<p>However, like any medical intervention, it is important to be aware of potential side effects to ensure the safety and well-being of the newborn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side effects of phototherapy include:</strong></li>
<li>Loose stools</li>
<li>Dehydration</li>
<li>Retinal damage</li>
<li>Hypocalcemia</li>
<li>Bronze <strong>baby syndrome</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grey</strong> <strong>baby syndrome</strong> is not a recognized side effect of phototherapy. Grey baby syndrome is a condition associated with the use of <strong><em>chloramphenicol,</em></strong> an antibiotic, in newborns. It is characterized by abdominal distension, vomiting, gray skin color, and potentially fatal cardiovascular collapse. It is unrelated to phototherapy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Dehydration can be a potential side effect of phototherapy. The exposure to phototherapy lights can increase insensible water loss from the baby's skin, leading to a higher risk of dehydration. Close monitoring of hydration status and adequate fluid intake is essential during phototherapy.</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong> Loose stools are a common side effect of phototherapy. The exposure to light can stimulate the intestines, leading to increased bowel movements and loose stools in some newborns.</li>
<li><strong>Option D: Retinal damage</strong> can occur if the newborn's eyes are not properly covered during phototherapy. The baby's eyes are sensitive to the bright light used in phototherapy, and prolonged exposure without eye protection can potentially lead to retinal damage. It is crucial to ensure that the newborn's eyes are adequately shielded with eye patches or protective eyewear during phototherapy.</li>

<li>During neonatal resuscitation, it is crucial to promptly identify and address any signs of inadequate circulation and low heart rate to ensure the newborn&rsquo;s well-being and improve their chances of survival.</li>
<li>Endotracheal intubation with chest compressions is the correct next step in the management of the newborn with a heart rate of less than 60 after 30 seconds of bag and mask ventilation.</li>
<li>Endotracheal intubation helps to secure the airway and allows for more effective ventilation.</li>
<li>The addition of chest compressions during endotracheal intubation further supports circulation and cardiac function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Chest compressions to a newborn can be given by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two finger technique (preferred)</li>
<li>Two thumb technique</li>
<li>Chest compressions are given to the lower ⅓ of the sternum.</li>
<li>⅓ of the distance between the anterior and posterior chest walls is compressed during each compression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Other options: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Normal bag and mask ventilation is not given during chest compressions. The patient is necessarily intubated before initiation of chest compressions.</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Adrenaline IV injection is indicated if the heart rate remains below the expected range despite adequate ventilation and chest compressions. However, in this scenario, the next step does not involve medication administration.</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong> Taking ventilation corrective steps may involve adjustments in ventilation technique, including ensuring proper mask fit, optimizing airway positioning, and adjusting ventilation pressure and rate. It is done when heart rate remains below 100 but above 60 after initial 30 seconds of bag and mask ventilation.</li>

<p>Apgar scoring is recorded in all newborn infants at 1 minute and 5 minutes to look for the adaptation to the extrauterine environment.</p>
<p>The scoring is based on the following parameters:</p>
<p><strong>Breathing/Respiration </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the infant is not breathing, the respiratory score is 0.</li>
<li>If respirations are slow and irregular, weak or gasping, the respiratory score is 1.</li>
<li>If the infant is crying vigorously, the respiratory score is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heart Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Note, heart rate is evaluated with a stethoscope, and it is the most critical part of the score in determining the need for resuscitation.</li>
<li>If there is no heartbeat, the heart rate score is 0.</li>
<li>If the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, the heart rate score is 1.</li>
<li>If the heart rate is more than 100 beats per minute, the heart rate score is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Muscle Tone&nbsp; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the muscle tone is loose and floppy without activity, the score for muscle tone is 0.</li>
<li>If the infant demonstrates some&nbsp;tone and flexion, the score for muscle tone is 1.</li>
<li>If the infant is in active motion with a flexed muscle tone that resists extension, the score for muscle tone is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grimace Response or Reflex Irritability in Response to Stimulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If there is no response to stimulation, the reflex irritability response score is 0.</li>
<li>If there is grimacing in response to stimulation, the reflex irritability response score is 1.</li>
<li>If the infant cries, coughs, or sneezes on stimulation, the reflex irritability response is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Note, most infants will score 1 for color as peripheral cyanosis is common among normal infants. Color can also be misleading in non-white infants.</li>
<li>If the infant is pale or blue, the score for color is 0.</li>
<li>If the infant is pink, but the extremities are blue, the score for color is 1.</li>
<li>If the infant is entirely&nbsp;pink, the score for color is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the Apgar score will be 2 for color, 2 for muscle tone, 2 for HR, and 1 for breathing effort. The total APGAR score will be 7.</p>
